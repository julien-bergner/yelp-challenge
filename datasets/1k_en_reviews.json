My mother always orders the same thing fresh fruit creeps . \n\nWhen my order came the pancakes look like hash brown. I knew I was going to like it because I love anything made with potato. But these pancakes where amazing. I tried it with Apple sauce and cream cheese. But I enjoyed it with maple syrup. It's like hash brown but sweeter.

I ordered a Best of Both (Fries and Rings) and made a portabello, bacon, lettuce jack/cheddar and banana pepper burger).  The menu is truly flexible with tons of free toppings as well as the portabello which costs an additional 1.99.   We also tried the chicken fingers, watermelon tea and watermelon shake.\n\nThe onion rings were very good in a tempura type batter instead of the usual breading  The fries were overloaded with pepper and seasoning and neither myself nor my dining companion enjoyed them.\n\nThe shake was excellent and I would recommend the shakes to anyone who tries this restaurant.\n\nMy daughter enjoyed the chicken fingers and they were actually moist inside.\n\nThe burger was serviceable. The best part was the portabello, a nice bun size mushroom fresh and flavorful.  The bacon was crisp and the other ingredients fresh.  I ordered the burger medium and it came just the right pink inside.  Unfortunately, when I broke a piece off to try it without the ingredients, it was flavorless and tough in places,.  With the ingredients it was a good burger, I didn't love the bun but it wasn't bad either.  The burger just doesn't stand alone.\n\nThe deserts look great but we were too full so I will update the next time we go.\n\nOverall a good addition to the burger scene and hopefully the burger will improve.", "review_id": "VM-FdUrbUp8TYOwfkGH6nA"}

On my first trip to C-squared I went with the classic chocolate shake and was disappointed I only ordered a 1/2 size one. It was awesome, made with actual chocolate ice-cream. That's a rarity. I used to think Denny's had the best shakes, now I think this joint does. Well done!\n\nAs far as the cheeburger goes - good grief do you have options. 25 free toppings which includes things like jalapenos, onion rings, standard burger veggies, guacamole - oh ya, and they're all FREE. Free is for me. That's the motto I live by at least. I took advantage of a good 10 or so toppings, ordered a 1/3lb burger, and proceeded to house that SOB.

They also had no flavor what so ever.  Took two bites and was done it was so small. The other burger that was the same size as my burger as ordered was twice as big and also cold.  My other friend ordered the pounder which is no bigger than any other large burgers in town and was very dry not cooked to order.\nAll three of us also ordered french fries the fries came out cold and needed seasoning but in all the best thing they had.  I ordered the onion rings they were some of the best in town.\nWe sat for nearly 15 minutes waiting to get our bill for our meal.

{"text": "Oh where to begin...  When we first arrived we were seated quickly in a too tight dining area.  My husbands chair was up against another customers chair.  There is no way to maneuver to get to your table so forget getting up to go to the bathroom because you will disrupt the diners around you.  We started w/3 waters with lemon.  Our server brought the waters .... no lemon.  We had to remind him twice to bring the lemon.   \n\nThe 1/3lb burger is tiny at best, the meat is about the size of a slider but the bun is a regular size burger bun.   A Mcdonald's cheeseburger from their dollar menu is bigger.   So I ordered a classic burger w/mayo/let/mushrooms cooked medium, My daughter had a classic burger cooked medium well w/mayo/let  only.  My husband ordered the pounder and he ordered the \"best of both\" with fries and onion rings.   My daughter and I opted to share a med. fries only.   \n\nMy burger arrived w/no mushrooms, my daughter's burger was blood rare and we did not get the fries we ordered.  The \"best of both\" was mediocre at best.  The breading used on the onion rings has no flavor and tastes blah so they probably only use flour on them without any type of  seasonings.  My husbands fries were heavily coated w/pepper and appeared old so he didn't even eat them.  \n\nI did send both mine and my daughters burger back to be fixed.   It took a while for the food to be returned, I also did inquire about the missing order of fries.  The server said \"oh sorry\" I guess I forgot to order them.   So about 15 mins. later and my daughter and I had finished our mini me burgers, we received fresh hot fries that had not been seasoned at all which was probably a good thing because at least they were edible, but again nothing special.    So all in all I would not recommend this place to anyone!!  It's also kind of pricey.   I received better service and tastier food at Smash burger and it's only a block further.   I will travel the extra block.   \n\nThis place may do better on the strip especially considering their higher prices and visitors would probably flock to it's doors not knowing any better.

The \"best of both\" was tasty however the onion rings were cut so thin that they reminded me of string fries in a bad way (-). The smallest burger that I would suggest is the semi-serious (highlighted on the menu) as the $1 difference is a noticeable upgrade. I had a hard time finding my classic burger underneath the bun. The picture displayed is the semi-serious burger. The hamburger buns are toasted with butter and made me smile while I jumped up and down. Fountain soda had a good mix and I guess that the price is okay since you get a free re-fill. Other items on the menu wings, shakes, malts, and salads were not sampled. Good nitch as they stayed true to the product \"cheese burgers\". Fair warning $$ and the burger free toppings have a great selection from lettuce to tomatoes however; the premium toppings such as bacon (.99) and mushrooms(.99) cost extra.

Lots of 50s decors to look at. Standard set-up with booths lining the walls and tables in the middle.\n\nOur server was friendly and attentive. Food is brought out by other staff and not your assigned server, and we noticed this resulted in some issues with food being brought to the wrong tables.\n\nThe big thing here - and the best part of dining here - is that you can design your own milkshake and your own burger. Like you can go crazy with the different possible combinations. \n\nCreating a milkshake was my favorite part. I went with a white chocolate M&M malt. It was seriously delicious! That said, though, it was not exactly the best quality or particularly well-made.\n\nWith the burgers, you choose the size (1/4 lb. to 1 lb.), the bun (just two options for bun), the cheese, and then any number of toppings. Some toppings like bacon cost extra. And while it's not listed on the menu, you can go for a 2 lb or 3 lb burger. \n\nIf you eat a \"pounder\", you get your picture taken with a giant stuffed burger and they put it up on the wall. James O., naturally, couldn't resist this challenge. \n\nI loved designing my own burger. Hint: Banana peppers are very tasty on a burger! However, the burger themselves weren't really anything to write home about. Just regular old burgers with not really any flavor or juiciness.\n\nYou can order your burger (and some other options like chicken and whatnot) as a platter, so it comes with fries or whatever side. Or you can order them a la carte and get a basket of fries or onion rings (or combo of both) to share. We opted to get a basket of fries and share. The fries were...well, fries. Good enough to eat. Nothing worthy of stuffing oneself with them or craving them. They also offer a variety of overpriced dipping sauces. While all were superior to regular old ketchup, none were exactly tasty.\n\nAll in all, this is a fun place. And my experience here was way better than a few years ago at their other Vegas location. Definitely family-friendly. And can even be a fun date spot. Go crazy creating fun milkshake and burger combinations. Do the eating challenge and devour a pounder. Just don't expect the best burger you've ever had.", "review_id": "BxXio1qk7ChSni4K59gHvg"}

For me the sign of great Mexican food is the guac and with pomegranate, it was perfectly seasoned.\n\nTacos were fab - good range of fillings (we had fish, steak and duck) and I loved them all as they were all sufficiently different with salad, veggie or spicy accompaniments!\n\nThe place is well staffed, food came quickly and good service. It's all dark wood, dark decor and rap music so more menacing Mexican rather than what you'd normally find in a chain. I loved it and can't wait to go back.\n\nSo, prices: margaritas - \u00a37.50, starters \u00a35, tacos (2 in serving) \u00a36.50 and chilli chocolate ice-cream \u00a32.

{"text": "Black walls, heavy hip hop beats on the stereo, cusions resplendant with Mexican wrestlers and Day of the Dead colourful skulls, a slushy machine mixing up a blueberry & rosewater frozen margarita, and a small but very effective menu of Mexican Street Food. Welcome to Edinburgh El Cartel, the likes of you has been sorely missed.\n\nMexican food in the UK is often thought of as \"take one tortilla, stuff it with a meat, stuff the rest of the space with cheese, pan-fry / deep fry / bake / leave as is, and serve with guac, salsa and sour cream. Rinse and repeat.\" I was always perplexed by the fact that an entire menu could be made of burritos, fajitas, chimichangas, tacos - and all these things were the same ingredients served in slightly different ways. And all of them were stody, heavy, flavoured with one spice, and not remotely Mexican.\n\nAnyway, that's enough of what El Cartel is not. What El Cartel is, is a breath of fresh air to the Mexican, and general dining, scene in Edinburgh. A one-side A5 menu that has about 5 small plates, then 5 taco options. And that's it. But trust me, that's all you need given how tasty and varied the options are.\n\nThe chorizo and plantain fritters were just a taste bomb in my mouth (taste bomb of goodness). The steak tacos, oh my. Black taco, fresh, with slices of freshly griddled steak still pink in the middles, with just the right amount of dressing and cheese to not overpower it. I'd say with two starters to share amongst three, and two tacos each, it was actually a really good feed -- and cheap too!\n\nThe blueberry frozen margarita to wind it all up was stroooonnnng but also good (I love tequila).\n\nI can see El Cartel becoming one of my favourite new eateries in Edinburgh. It's no secret or surprise that the minds behind the Bon Vivant and Devil's Advocate can do no wrong -- and this newest little brother restaurant is testament to that.

{"text": "I was on a mission to try this new restaurant. After having spoken with a fellow foodie I had learnt that El Cartel make everything fresh by hand. Which meant they make fresh tortillas by hand !! This is a big deal. They also don't use the usual, masa harina but blue corn which is much more flavoursome. I was sold. It's been practically impossible to find this level of freshness with Mexican food in Edinburgh, I had to try it ASAP!\n\nWe trucked along, to the old tex mex 2 location and were sat in a lovely booth. I was very impressed with the music selection, it's not everyday (or ever) that you hear souls of mischief in public these days.\n\n  The menu is very minimal but everything is cooked fresh, prepared to order. We ordered the guacamole & plantains, which were light and crispy. The guacamole had a little spice but nothing my toddler couldn't stand and was topped with fresh and sweet pomegranate seeds. Very lovely with the avocado pieces, and chunks of Mexican cheese (maybe cotija? A crumbly and light not very overpowering cheese) everything very fresh and tasty. And spot on taste wise.\n\nThe tacos were very good, each pair comprising of many different toppings. The steak had salsa verde some kind of cabbage and spring onions . The tortillas were very tasty, they had this nice earthy corn taste that you  don't get from the store bought ones. Very authentic indeed. \n\nThe carnitas pibil was spicier but also very tasty. The pork is roasted with ancho chilies  and quite literally smothered in a red onion escabeche but seemed more pickeled to me. Either way very flavourful and delightful.  We all enjoyed every bite.\n\nReally impressed and hope that this place does really well as the food is excellent and it is quite nice to eat homemade tortillas!", "review_id": "6NhmOe2iIQAe6SYOci3kqw"}

{"text": "El Cartel is exactly what you'd expect from the team behind The Bon Vivant - slick service, bangin' food and dangerously delectable cocktails.\n\nMy favourite thing about it is that these guys are consistent, putting them a mile above many other Edinburgh hotspots which can elate quite as often as they deflate. Everyone I've raved to about this place has raved straight back at me, which screams out that El Cartel is a winner. Nothing worse than recommending a spot to pals only for them to have a totally average experience.\n\nThey have a pretty small space, but a bit of clever table arranging means that there are lots of cosy corner tables to be had. Decor is minimalistic, with plenty of skull art provides a welcome pop of colour. Baby cacti are dotted around, but beware a lot of them sit at ass-height.\n\nAnd the food. Every time I go I face the same dilemma - I want it all. Roughly 5 'starters' and 6 tacos, of which I think 2 flavours tend to rotate. The guacamole is wildly good - topped with feta & pomegranate, so you get the creamy avo, salty cheese, then a burst of fresh & fruity pom. These flavours dance across the tongue as if a Mariachi band were serenading the lucky diner (please note: ECM does not do Mariachi, it does hiphop). Served with pork cracklin' and/or plantain chips for dunking. I never go without it.\n\nTacos all come in pairs making them easy to share. Again with the flavour dance: there is so much going on in each bite, in a very good way. Bang coriander! Bang chilli! Bang delicious meaty goodness! Everything is fantastically fresh, with brilliant texture and interesting combinations - so far removed from the stereotypical fajita/burrito/nacho situation which Edinburgh's Mexican scene has been guilty of for a long time. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just brilliant to see the team here showcasing an alternative to Tex-Mex.\n\nAnd now, the drinks. As if you needed another reason to hit this place up. El Cartel offers a rainbow of frozen margaritas, with flavours changing daily. Again, they avoid the stereotype and focus on seasonally flavours alongside classic margaritas such a the Tommy's. All tart & tasty with a good kick of Tequila. Speaking of Tequila, on the last count their menu boasted more than 50, and the knowledgeable team are more than happy to chat you through the options.\n\nWith food service running until midnight at the weekends, it's a great place to satisfy a booze induced hunger. Alternatively, the homemade sangrita would make a dynamite hair of the dog when charged with Mezcal. And the food comes fast which is exactly what you need the afternoon-after (doors open at midday meaning there's no reason to get out of bed earlier).\n\nEvery time I leave I'm already thinking about when I can next go back, and who I can show this little gem off to. A definite contender for best casual dining in Edinburgh.", "review_id": "RMzpGubgQASdbzABVg6b9A"}
{"text": "when i saw that the doors of Tex Mex II were closed for good, i'll admit i was a bit heartbroken.  it had been one of my favourite mexican restaurants in edinburgh and to see that it was gone left me both nacho-less and with a small burrito sized hole in my heart.  but then, as the restaurant world turns, El Cartel opened its doors full of mexican goodness.\n\nEl Cartel is conveniently owned by the Bon Vivant (which appears to be building a small edinburgh empire) that is basically across the street.  but instead of the cocktails and bistro food this is very much tequila and tacos.  i went for lunch time between christmas and new year and at 1pm found the place completely empty.  i was a bit surprised as there is always a bit of hype around a new restaurant but this suited me fine as it meant i had my pick of tables.  the layout remains very similar to Tex Mex but has a more rustic feel with some exposed brick walls and dark wood furniture match with purple hues.  it's cosy enough although was bloody freezing when i went for lunch!\n\nwhen my friend arrived we decided to order a few tacos to spilt between us and the guacamole.  as some have mentioned previously the guacamole with plantain chips is the true standout dish.  it was simple and delicious and i wish they had it in a to go option to take home.  between us we had the fish tacos, duck tacos, and plantain tacos.  they were all good, i particularly enjoyed the plantain ones but found the portions to be tiny.  this was good for lunch as you probably don't want a massive portion but may leave you hungry after dinner.\n\nwe didn't try any drinks (it was lunchtime afterall) but they have a few varieties of margaritas on offer that would be good to try another time.  i do plan to go back, but not in a rush.  i thought the price was a bit high for what was on offer and while the quality was good there was just something lacking.  i know a new restaurant takes time to bed in so i'll make a point to visit again in another few months for the guacamole if nothing else.", "review_id": "r8QngG7jnWNJhM4O0-k_jg"}

We visited this place twice because we loved it so much so got to sample a few of them.  Our favourite was the fish tacos, but the pork and duck were also both excellent. \n\nThe staff were really friendly but not overbearing and the margarita's were refreshing and a perfect accompaniment to the food.  \n\nThey've kitted the place out with dark colours and bright Mexican skulls which match the rugged rap music which pumps the ambience of the entire place with an edgy (yet not pretentious)  hipster feel. \n\nHighly highly recommended!", "review_id": "z4iZH4lYVCXXLNo7wpQuYw"}

Westside residents may love their old trees & greenway but while Dunkin Donuts has wifi & Pinky's has delicious food there's hasn't been a place to just be.\n\nStarted by a former Common Market employee with the CM owner's blessing, Rhino Market offers their own interpretation of the familiar CM format of great beer & wine selection with a delicious deli.

High quality breads, meats & cheeses with plenty of vegetarian options remain at core.\n\nThe space is new so it lacks the gritty character of PM or Southend but I'm sure it's own decor & identity will come with time.

{"text": "Fiiii-nally! This place was long anticipated in FreeMoreWest and thankfully it delivered. I was worried the food wouldn't be any better than boring Common Market, but thankfully it is definitely better and more interesting. I was lucky enough to get a sneak peek and tasting of the menu before it opened and Rob was great about taking feedback and is still making adjustments. \n\nThe space is light, airy and lofty. At first it's jarring if you're used to Common Market, but it's actually so nice because it's not claustrophobic and cramped like CM. It's also sunny, which can be a bad thing but it's just a bit happier. I have been in there a few times where there was only outdoor seating available which isn't great if it's 45 degrees but it will be rocking this summer. \n\nOnto the menu! The Chaud Legumes sandwich has nice warm juicy portabella mushrooms. It's super tasty on their GF (gluten free) bread option (butter lettuce) but be warned- it's so juicy it's messy. Their normal bread for that is ciabatta (ask for that grilled too). As someone else mentioned the chicken torta is substantial and delicious. It's a big hunka sandwich and great if you're a hungry hungry rhino. \n\nThe salads are also great. Their basic chicken salad is definitely light on the mayo (rejoice!) and chunky chicken, not that mushy shit people are peddling these days. It has grapes (wish their were more) and celery for crunch. Simple, but tasty and full of protein. Their Rhyno salad is delish as is their spinach bacon (add avo). Their citrus vin far outweighs their red wine vin. It's nice to see a nicoise salad in Charlotte (though I do with they'd go for it and add tuna. \n\nChilly? Rhino also has soups, including a daily vegan Garden Veggie Soup that is healthy, hearty and heavenly. Other daily specials change all the time. The only thing I wish is they had a crusty bread / roll to buy along with it. \n\nI haven't tried their breakfast sandwiches / burritos but I have had their coffee (all local brews) and are delicious. Enderly coffee on tap? Yeahhhhhh.  They also have local brews and national  microbrews and a giant selection of really good wines and even bubbly ( Roederer Estate!). Rob's done a great job of selecting goodies. Their small fridge by the deli features salami, cheese, small sides of pasta & chicken salad to go, but also desserts including a locally made cheesecake company called QC cheesecake. Pumpkin bourbon cheesecake? Don't mind if I do. They also have other good looking things I shouldn't try in there as well. \n\n It will be interesting to see how much they add over time.", "review_id": "45V9CVVWY2JsLKwledo_QA"}

I like that there is now somewhere closer to my apartment for baked goods!\n\nThe owners today were very friendly, and while the selection is currently small, they conveyed that this is temporary.  There were still many interesting breads to chose from and a few flavors of scones.  I believe there was also coffee and tea.  I ordered a sour cream cranberry coffee cake muffin ($2.50).  For the size, I thought the bakery was a little pricey, as there are a lot of cheaper bakeries in the area.  However, the quality was great.  It will be interesting to see the complete selection as time goes on.  I'm still partial to Allegro Hearth because the prices are lower, and they have the bread card for discounts.

They said they would start to offer a couple of sandwiches soon too and they also had brewed coffee (but no espresso options I could see). There is a small seating area available inside.  The person who helped me (maybe the owner?) was very friendly and happy to tell me about all his offerings and they had a couple things out to sample.

Their online menu shows only the special-order items, not the everyday one-offs that you can find in the shop.

Food and drinks were over priced. The happy hour specials are closer to normal prices.\n\nSeating was...interesting. The dining area is mostly outside and set up like a bar rather than a restaurant. There is also a 'lounge' area with cushioned benches and coffee tables. At the dining tables, you get either a bench seat, stool, or horribly uncomfortable chair. I had to swap out my chair for a stool shortly after being seated, and I noticed another lady also opting for a different seat.\n\nI have to say, after seeing the high prices I was prepared to dislike this place, but we really got our value for the food we ordered.

I was just able to \"just' finish everything on my plate and my wife wasn't.  We both left full!  \n\nOverall\n\nHaving been to the Tucson locations this new one in Chandler is on par with the others.  I had a great tasting margarita and enjoyed the chips and salsa while waiting for our food.  When the food arrived it tasted great.  The automotive garage theme they have going on works.  Outside dining and the ability to watch the game worked.  With the amount of quality food and drink we got the price worked.

Instead it is a mixture of chicken, cream cheese, jalapeno, chipolte sauce and maybe a couple of other items thrown in all wrapped up in a chimichanga type of wrap. I did not care for this at all.

If you like chicken salad, you might like this, if you hate mushy texture, you will hate it.\n\nI did also try the La Bomba soft pretzel with strips of poblano peppers and swiss cheese and served with nacho cheese dipping sauce and mustard, I did like this a lot. On our second visit which was on New Years day I tried the Sonoran Dog. I did not care for this either. For me the hot dog itself was way too salty. The beer battered fries are however delicious. On New Years day they also had a DJ at 7:30pm who was just bumping beats the entire time we were there. It seemed like he was trying to turn the place into a night club. The music selection was terrible, with rap songs melding into country. It was extremely off putting. My fiance and I could not carry a conversation because of the mini night club situation. The DJ was the only one dancing and was clearly enjoying himself very much.\n\nIf it were up to me I probably would not come back.

Our entire dining experience was fabulous. \n\nWhat does Scottsdale, AZ have in common with Dubai and Hong Kong? TORO.  \n\nWe are staying at the Fairmont Princess so you can catch the complimentary Mercedes shuttle from the main portico at the hotel...it's only a mile or less to the restaurant. \n\nIt's Asian + South American fusion. And it rocks! Sushi + ceviche? Sashimi and lomo saltado? Why not?   \n\nAs we perused the menu, we had a lovely visit from the Rum Princess (love that they have a Rum Princess in lieu of a sommelier) to help us navigate the extensive spirits selection. \n\nRather than narrow our choice down to two mains, we ordered five small plates/apps and ALL were terrific.\n\nAfter ordering, a couple of warm, fabulous, cheesy rustic rolls appeared with a light and bright tomato/onion ...then to find out it is GLUTEN FREE, made with yuca flour - very HAPPY!!  \n\nWe tried the hamachi toradito, lamb skewers, angry tuna roll, short rib flatbread and the steak tartare. \n\nNow, if we were forced at gunpoint only to choose three of those again, we'd say that you CANNOT MISS the lamb skewers, steak tartare, and angry tuna roll. \n\nHuh? \n\nYep. A sushi roll, and grilled skewer and a classically french dish...all at the same restaurant and all are standouts.  \n\nNah - we'd probably just take the risk of the bullet and order them all again. \n\nThe flatbread with the pulled pork rib meat, manchego cheese, horseradish cream, caramelized onions...yum! The hamachi with sriracha...everything is better with sriracha. \n\nGF? - you are in GREAT shape here. Tons of choices. Vegans, pescatarians, frugans, paleos, carnivores, finicky kids...I think you've found a happy place. There is something here for everyone and that includes foodies alike.   \n\nA wonderful Martin Codex albarino topped it all off...absolutely perfect. Here we are, ranting and raving about the food because that is the point of dining out - you do not notice the service because it was spot on and the ambiance (center bar with tv's for those wandering sports fans' eyes) was very complementary.      \n\nTIP: Food production was FAST. If ordering multiple small plates, order in waves so that they do not all arrive at once...or let your server know to stagger the order. \n\nGreat job, all you peeps at Toro! Good luck on your grand opening!!", "review_id": "My2kNHK0XsqPkmCgl9eD8g"}
{"text": "I note at the time of this review this restaurant is newly opened and still might be working things on the menu out.\n\nFirst of all maybe the most useful information needed is that you must use the address posted on Yelp and not the Fairmont Princess Address posted on the Toro Website or you will be in a mess and will have to use the Fairmont Shuttle Bus that may or may not be running to get to the Toro Restaurant and Rum Bar.\n\nWhen we finally found this restaurant sort of hidden in the Fairmont Golf Course we found that it didn't have a sign. You will know your in the right place when you see the bottles of rum and restaurant tables.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is very slick and modern with a big sushi/ceviche bar in the middle of the room.  We decided to sit on the patio with lovely views of the golf course and the McDowel Mountain Range.\n\nThe menu is Pan Latin Cuisine. We were told the menu is mostly Peruvian with flavors but blended with Asian too. \n\nThis restaurant features a rum bar but I didn't partake in alcohol and had Iced Tea and water instead. The restaurant could use more filtration as the water had an off taste I didn't like.\n\nWe started with the Angry Tuna Roll. It was made with quality Tuna that was delicious. I liked that they dotted each piece with actual wasabi sauce. The tuna really was spicy and the rolls sat on some sort of Thai Chili Sauce. The Angry Tuna Roll was really very good. \n\nFor me what wasn't as well received as the Tuna Roll was the Chicken Soup (Caldo De Pollo). It was presented to us as cold pulled chicken in a bowl with some rice and a little bit of something like pico and a little pitcher of warm water laced with a little bit of chicken flavor that you pour on. This soup was very weak in flavor. TO BE FAIR as possible I do think maybe the soup might have had more flavor if the liquid was hot enough to bloom whatever was in the bowl and maybe you might get a better tasting soup than I got. The waiter asked us how it was when we were finished with it and my husband told the waiter the soup was very bland. The waiter thanked us for the imput.\n\nWe also shared the Lomo Sactado. It was delicious and made with Medium Rare  (almost too close to rare for me) Tenderloin and Crispy Fries as promised. It was really a very tasty Stir Fry in a Soy Jus. The tomatoes and onions just tied it together. I do think they should ask you how you want the meat cooked in this dish. I'm OK on a tenderloin with M/R but not everyone is.\n\nThe kitchen was very good about splitting our plates for us.\n\nI really want to give this new place 3.5 stars but if I have to decide between 3 and 4 I'm closer to three stars on this one mostly because of the Weak Chicken Soup, the very high prices on the iced tea and soda ($5.or a small glass of soda) and the rest already mentioned.\n\n3.5 stars", "review_id": "Sy7XdLKoI7dQNsYS2XwRiw"}

{"text": "A\nlove\ntrain\n\nURRKN stands for Underground Railroad Rescue Kitty Network and was started by Tina LaBlanc in Oct of 2011.  It's a way of transporting kitties from shelters, foster homes and temporary homes to their \"forever homes\".\n\nIt's basically a series of wonderful volunteers that are willing to transport cats from one place to another.  One long trips each volunteer will drive whatever distance they feel comfortable and then meet another volunteer at a prearranged location.\n\nOn a long trip it might be many volunteers that selflessly give their time and transportation to help the kitty get to it's finally destination.  A person waiting for the kitty can actually keep track on the progress as the cat travels on it's \"love train\".\n\nWe recently adopted a kitty from Florida that had to be transported to Rhode Island.  We contacted URRKN and volunteers were quickly arranged so our kitty, Gersemi, arrived to us quickly and in great health and spirits.\n\nThere is no charge for this incredible service but of course donations are accepted.  It all depends on the kindness and generosity of strangers who anonymously do good without asking for anything but a simple thank you.\n\nThe volunteers of the URRKN along with Tina LaBlanc, are doing great deeds in a quiet way.  Such acts of kindness for no other reason but to be kind are wonderful and rare things that should never be taken for granted.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/URRKN/", "review_id": "j1Ms3yCl_cDLGMh5kdjIHg"}
{"text": "I was a volunteer driver for two years for URRKN.  They are a nonprofit 501c (3) organization run by Tina LaBlanc and her husband.  I was very excited to be a member with all these cat lovers taking cats to their forever homes.  Unfortunately, there is a dark side to URRKN.  Tina LaBlanc was asking members to donate to various causes that covered personal, not URRKN related, expenses for Tina and other Administrators only.  From trips, vacations, car repairs and clothing to house upgrades.  All members, including management, are volunteers and provide their time free of reimbursement.  URRKN is not a rescue, foster, or other pet related organization.  It is a transportation group only.  Moving cats from point A to point B, all free of charge.  Any expenses for the cat is absorbed by the adopter and adoptee.\nIt was also brought to my attention that transports were based on how big a donation you made to URRKN, not the first come first serve basis we all thought.  Some transports were taking up to 5 months to organize.  Others in two weeks.\nJust recently, a You Caring request for $3000 in funds was posted on the members page requesting donations to fix a administrators car.  At this time, no administrator is taking a salary or being reimbursed for expenses.  I questioned these donations and was banned from commenting.  I since realized that URRKN was violating 501c(3) nonprofit operation rules and found another group to drive for who is totally transparent.\nBefore you join or donate, please research this organization.  Do not be taken advantage of like I was.", "review_id": "FEuquYFoUpzpXCGLBZAbuw"}
{"text": "Unfortunately, this group does not always get their kitties to their new adoptees.  One cat was lost while in the care of an URRKN overnight hostess's home.  As of this date, she has not been found and its been a year.  The adopter is still devastated.  Another adopter received a kitten with a deadly virus that not only killed the kitten, but, also infected two of her family cats, one who perished along with the kitten.\nMismanaged donations and unfair scheduling of transports are just a couple of concerns for this group.  It appears the more money you donate the more VIP treatment you get.  Some transports take 5 months to organize where the norm is 2 to 3 weeks.  If you want your kitty you need to shell out the money.\nURRKN has been known to transport kitties across state lines with no Health Certificates.  Hence, sick kittens are being transported when they should be under vet care.  Donations cannot be accounted for and are being requested by management from the members to support management personal causes as in eye surgery, home improvements, car repairs, etc.\nBefore you donate or become a member, please research this organization and its reputation.", "review_id": "a4VOtKdjbsa3zadzY_24rw"}
{"text": "So I feel the need to respond to the negative reviews, especially Brenda T.  Our Gersemi was transported prior to our donation being sent in.  So it is simply not true that  the cats will not be transported unless large sums of money are donated. \n\nIt is true that organization times vary.  Ours was fairly long - but that was the fault of the foster mom and myself not staying \"on task\".  Certainly, one of the tie-ups was getting Gersemi's health records, without which she would not have been transported.  So any driver should know that they are transporting a sick or contagious cat, and keep it isolated during transport.  If the adopter is so equipped to nurse a sickly cat back to health, or willing to share their home with only one cat because it has FIV and is contagious, more power to her/him.  \n\nI cannot speak to the incidences of volunteers being asked to donate money for administrators expenses.  That would be a \"poor choice\" on Tina's part.  If asked, just say \"no\".  Unfortunately, in large organizations, there are always personal friendships that develop that may appear to be favoritism or, on the other hand, conflicts that arise.  It's just not logical to expect anything else.\n\nOur particular experience happened to be superlative.  All the volunteers were spot on.  Everyone kept everyone else informed as to the progress, where Gersemi was, and when the next transporter could expect her to arrive.  Even had a short update from the person at the B&B.  Gersemi arrived in apparent good condition and good spirits.  Especially after having spent two days in various cars.  In fact, I think Gersemi took to it better than my husband does/did!", "review_id": "o4J_i20hHLWAgamGRJSZ5w"}

The presentation and appearance of all of our dinners was excellent. The flavors in my Cornish hen and the sides were delicious. What I am in shock over is the portion and the price. The menu states \"Cornish hen\", it is $23 and there is no mention of the portion. It was not a full Cornish hen. It was not a half Cornish hen. It was a 1/4 Cornish hen. One very small leg connected to one very small thigh. That's it.

I had read that Oliver's price point was supposed to fall between nearby Lombardino's ($$$) and Blue Moon ($$), and was pretty shocked when I saw that most main courses were actually in the $18-$30 range. I ordered one of the less expensive dishes, the macaroni, and found it to be a little burnt. When I ordered the macaroni, the waitress asked me \"would you like a soup or salad with that?\" so I requested the soup, assuming that it was included in my dish - I was then shocked to find that an $8 charge for soup was included in my bill. I thought that this was pretty misleading. \n\nOn the pro side, the soup, bread appetizer, and cocktails were really good. But again, they were a little too expensive (minus the bread, which was complimentary). I really really hope that Oliver's lowers their prices or adds some cheaper dishes (e.g. burgers and sandwiches).

Unfortunately, the kinks were not worked out by the time of our visit.\nThe interior is warm and inviting and caught our eye when we walked by. There is a bar as you walk in with some seating and the a larger dining room in the back. When I saw \"public house\" as part of the restaurant's name, I was expecting a menu more focus on casual fare with a few sandwich options. Not the case here. With entrees in the high teens-low 20's and appetizers hovering around $10, the bill can get pretty high pretty quick. \nWhile the craft cocktails were worthy of their price point, the food was definitely not. I was impressed when the waitress steered my daughter away from the $15 adult mac and cheese and towards the version on the kids menu (she thought the adult maybe had too strong of flavors). I was not impressed to find out the bland kids version (served with ice cream) was $14. This is an absolute joke. My girlfriend went went the clans and mussels while I opted for the whitefish sticks appetizer and squash soup. The mussel/clam combo had a nice broth and served with grilled bread for dipping. But, for perhaps 7 mussels and another 6 clams, $16 is priced too high. My whitefish appetizer (with homemade chips) was fine but again overpriced ($10). On the other hand, my squash soup missed the mark severely. It took on the taste of the kale and was finished inexplicably with balsamic vinegar-completely masking the flavor of the creamy squash. \nParking is hard to come by (there is a space for patrons about a half block away) and with price points this high (and not having the food to match), I would be surprised if it lasts even a year.

There literally were no other guests at the time. Not a great first impression and we asked to be moved. The waitress was lovely - savvy, smart and well informed. Menu is quite limited, but I prefer that since the quality is often better. We had the nightly sausage appetizer, pork shoulder and crepes. It was good - not great.

The cinnamon-pear was my favorite but the beet ice cream with chocolate covered walnuts was impressive. I love beets but was a little hesitant to try them in my ice cream.

As it was cold and blustery, I opted for the Glazed Pork Shoulder that sat on top  of a white bean puree, accompanied with roasted apple and bacon lardons.  I can respect the farm to table element but for $21, I found the pork shoulder to be a little tough and dry (neither of which I would expect from a Berkshire hog).\nI still feel, over time, when the bright shiny feel of a new restaurant wears off in the community, Oliver's will have difficulty pulling in the customer's.  Let's face it, there are many places in Madison that espouse farm to table at similar price points which execute and deliver more solidly than Oliver's.  I will be back for drinks but methinks not for anything food related.", "review_id": "huItPDyyhd13BuQawDbHtw"}

The place has a feel of a welcoming neighborhood bar mixed with an upscale country club with creative designer cocktails (try the grapefruit shocker omg!!) and eclectic snacks and sandwiches that made this foodie squeal with delight.  We had the meat and cheese board which had a wonderful mix of delicious artisan cheeses, Italian meats and pickled vegetables. This was definitely on par (no pun intended, well maybe a little) with anything at a 5 star restaurant. We also had a couple of \"Smashies\" which are their version of a panini and those were delightful as well. Hub fans will see some familiar items, such as the smoked wings, but again they knock it out of the park with the new Watermelon flavor--sweet and savory with just a hint of melon. Everything we tried was just a scale above everywhere else. It is also important to note that the management and the staff were awesome. The manager Chad and the waitress Nicole made us feel so welcome and even recognized that we were regulars at the Hub.

{"text": "Four friends and I came along to the VIP preview tasting meal this evening. We were each allowed unlimited green tea and miso soup, in addition to any four dishes from the menu. Only one of our ordered dishes could be hot but we were able to take anything from the conveyor belt.\n\nYo sushi is part of a national chain, but this particular location is really fantastic in that it offers a beautiful view onto Princes street gardens and Edinburgh castle. The seating, as in all Yo Sushi restaurants, is a little cramped and finding a place to put your bags/coats is kind of awkward. That said, this restaurant is more spacious than many other branches.\n\nDespite being busy on opening night the staff were very professional and approachable. I ordered the tofu katsu curry, a dish I know from other yo sushi restaurants. I took the aubergine salad, the Kaiso salad and the strawberry cheesecake mochi from the conveyor belt. \n\nThe refillable green tea and miso soup is a quite convenient idea. Had we not had so much too eat I would have surely refilled my miso soup several times. It took a while to receive my tofu katsu curry and it wasn't really up to the same standard as I have had it in other Yo Sushi locations. There was not enough sauce and one of the chefs happily added more for me when I requested it, but it was somehow more watery than it should have been. The panko breadcrumbs were faultless. Perhaps this dish could have done with less rice and more tofu? The aubergine dish was a highlight, the sweet miso sauce was delicious and the aubergine itself melt-in-the-mouth. The kaiso salad was less adventurous, an easy-to-assemble dish combining edamame beans, wakame seaweed, carrot and a sweet miso dressing. It was nonetheless very enjoyable. Another star of the meal, as I agreed with a friend who took the same, was the strawberry cheesecake. The texture and appearance was rather odd, but imagine sweet rice balls with a warm cheesecake filling... Okay, no description can give this pudding justice, just try it. Or maybe don't, at \u00a34.30 the price tag is a little exaggerated. \n\nOverall my friends seemed happy with their choices. The pumpkin korroke (fried breadcrumb encrusted pumpkin) seemed a popular choice whilst the katsu dishes seem to need a little work.\n\nI would definitely come back here to make use of the Blue Monday deal whilst gazing out at the castle.", "review_id": "FCalpQKCjzZHOmbUdKcrGQ"}
{"text": "Finally Edinburgh has a proper branch of Yo! No more cramming in to a tiny space on the top floor of Harvey Nicks.\n\nBeing slap bang in the middle of Princes Street I'm sure this branch will prove popular, if just for convenience. It follows the tried and tested Yo! formula - sushi and other assorted bites on colour coded plates whizzing past you on a conveyor belt. It's nice to sit by the bar and gawp at the talent of the sushi chefs (seriously, how good must their knife skills be to slice fish that precisely?) but in this branch it would be worth napping a booth in the window and enjoying the view of the castle, gardens and shoppers below.\n\nStaff fairly friendly (and hopefully this won't wear off with time) and nothing to fault it. I'll definitely be back", "review_id": "MGeqbZpbjTOuShBb-amwSg"}
{"text": "I really wanted to give this place 4 stars but just couldn't, we'll get to that later. Starting from the beginning, this was my first time visiting Yo Sushi. I had heard about the conveyer belt and thought it would be a fun place to take my daughter for our lunch. We were sat in a corner booth with views of the Wallace monument and all the Christmas attractions and on our other side, the Edinburgh castle. Really really great location with stunning views. Great big star for views. \n\nI started off with the bottomless miso soup, yes indeed, they offer unlimited refills of their very lovely miso. This earns them another star right off the bat. My daughter loves Japanese food and the waiters were all very sweet and playful with her, which was super nice of them. \n\nThe food was good, we happened to go there on a Monday which has a special \"blue Monday\" deal. This means that certain plates are \u00a32.50. It was really easy to order off of the blue Monday menu as it had a really large variety of plates. The gyozas were really tasty and crispy, the tempura was okay, a bit sparse but this is the first place that I have seen have avocado tempura here in Edinburgh which was really lovely. My daughter literally inhaled her chicken katsu and the  noodle dish I had was delicious. All the food was well prepared and very tasty, my only gripe would be the portions, they are tiny!  But still, big shiny star for really tasty fare.\n\nOk, so now onto why I gave this place 3 and not 4 stars, the music. The music was way too loud!! I don't mind music and I don't mind any genre  but if you blast music really loudly, it will turn off your guests, unless they are wasted or getting there. Honestly I left with a bit of a headache and the loudness of the music distressed my daughter a bit at first.  If they turned down the music a few notches the whole experience would be way better. Just shows how important music/ambience is to eating.  \n\nSo there you have it. Dependable quality food, small portions a bottomless miso but really freaking loud music.", "review_id": "GI1jpyW1prv5lvNFh1N43Q"}

It was informative and fun!\n\nWe then got to play with \"Dad\" who showed us how to use a piping bag to decorate Christmas Cookies! Woo Hoo! Mine turned out looking like something from a Salvador Dali acid trip but hey, it was a blast!\n\nThey gave us a 15% discount and I took them up on it by buying the 16 box of truffles and 3 chocolate roses for a friend. It turned out to be quite the deal because true \"truffles\" can be $3 or even $4 EACH in some \"gourmet\" chocolate shops. With the discount they came out to be less than $2 a pop!

And later on turned out he was so attentive (checking on us every 5 minutes, which feels a little bit weird but I know he's doing it out of care)\n\nWe ordered the shogun burger, which was sooooo amazing!

{"text": "The Black & Green Wagyu Beef Burger was everything that I hoped it would be.  Juicy.  Flavors that truly did evolve with each bite.  The bleu cheese, bacon, and mushrooms played nicely with each other.  I was thinking about building my own burger, but for my first visit, I thought it was a safer choice to go with something that their chefs created, which is what I recommend you do as well, if you're a first timer.  The Peking Duck Bao's were awesome as well.  The Bao was so soft and fluffy, and the sweet hoisin-like sauce was perfect with them.  I saved the Ox Tail Chili Fries for last, as they were the most surprising to me.  I expected everything to be great here, but these awesome fries had me feeling some type of way!  Keep in mind, I had already devoured my big burger, and had some Duck Bao's, and I couldn't stop eating the Ox Tail Chili Fries.  The Ox Tail meat is shredded and mixed into the chili, which has a semi-sweet flavor.  The egg, sriracha mayo type sauce, jalapenos, and cilantro created this perfect combination of flavors, and this will now be ordered every time I come here.  The ambiance was nice.  Their staff was tentative, and we will be back.", "review_id": "inefuj0gqZ-BF86PboLu-g"}

I know it's just burgers but match that with quality beef and the freshest of ingredients and you get one succulent and gratifying meal. I got the Kiki burger, there was a lot going on with all the components but all the flavors melded together creating an incredible burger paired with truffle fries and the moan inducing (in a good way of course!) salted caramel marshmallow shake. Hubby got the Mr. Ho's burger which was amazing as well (if you love lap cheong this is definitely the burger for you) with salt and pepper fries and a guava milkshake.\n\nSure they're a little pricier than your average burger joint, but I'd pay LV strip prices any day to get the first class quality of food and service here.\nShout out to the manager Chris who came out to chat with us and was very proud of his work of art (milkshakes) and their house made caramel and marshmallow.

My burger came nicely presented in a bed of lettuce and had saut\u00e9ed mushrooms galore. I asked for a chili mayo off of one of the other burgers that staff was more then willing to provide. 4 adults had an appetizer, 4 burgers, and 6 drinks and bill was $94. I was pleased.

I remember marking my notes with not only the location but what to order (oxtail chili cheese fries) and the cost $8.99.      As usual,  after Guy leaves,  things change.  The chili cheese fries didn't have a morsel of oxtail.  I found a few hair strand like pieces in the chili but that was it.  To make matters worse, the price had been increased to $11.

Our server Ray was attentive, and very helpful with suggestions. \n\nMiyagi San- The Wagyu patty was cooked perfectly. The bun was nice and soft. The onion rings were soggy/oily. All the flavors went together beautifully, but the flavor profile was just TOO SWEET. They put way too much furikake for my liking. A heaping amount of furikake paired with the glaze on the patty made the amount of sweetness overbearing. \n\nOxtail Chili Cheese Fries- DELICIOUS!! ...but again, TOO SWEET! The chili was too sweet and overpowered the oxtail. They used the sweet white beans like you see in Pork & Beans, and I think that just threw the whole dish off. They could have balanced the flavors better by chopping up the jalape\u00f1os and cilantro so all the flavors can come together in each bite. \n\nOverall, it was nice to try, but I don't see myself coming back.

I'll make up for it. Jillian Michaels is gonna kick my butt but it was worth it. \n\nWe were in for a tasty treat. We started out with the Bachi pickle plate. Consisted of a variety of pickled veggies. Not something we'd normally order but it was tasty, fun and a nice start for the palate. Eye appeal. \nI had the Kiki's burger and hubby had the Miyagi-San. Both medium. Both delicious, cooked to perfection and loaded with flavor. I didn't need the side sauce. I dipped some of mine in hubby's burger drippings lol. Holy cow. So good. I could only eat half of mine. We split the Salt & Pepper fries topped with fresh jalape\u00f1os and cilantro. And I think shredded ginger maybe? Tasty and salty. Dipping sauce was good, but again, I almost didn't need it. Finished off the salty meal with a salted caramel shake topped with roasted marshmallow. Wow. I could only have a few sips. We decided we'll be splitting a burger next time since we want to try the oxtail fries and the 'seasonal warm bread pudding' with butter cream ice cream (or something like that) and bourbon sauce. Hope the bread pudding is still there by the time we come back. Yeah we'll be back .. after several hard workouts and a bit of lean, clean eating that's for sure.

I have to say I didn't miss it, and I've been eating those sandwiches since my childhood. At first it looked like they skimped on meat but it was perfect. I loved it.\n\nTheir pho was good.

It's obvious that a lot of time and money was put into updating the interior from Ziggy's to Patriot. They took out a partition wall that separated the restaurant from the bar, elevated the booths around the inside walls, added the \"barrel booth\", etc. \n\nWe have only visited Patriot once since it opened, and I have rated it four stars based on the potential that is there. Given that it's a new establishment, to grade it with the same criteria I would as a well-established restaurant/bar would be unfair in my opinion. It seems to me that they have the right structure and business model in place, just need to work out a few kinks which are commonly found with new restaurants.\n\nPros:\n-Menu resembles that of a \"gastropub\" in many ways, with both unique offerings (pork belly sliders, salt-and-pepper calamari) and standards (burgers, wings).\n-Beer selection: 30 on tap, including many craft and local selections.\n-Atmosphere fosters both those looking for a \"restaurant\", and those looking for a place to drink beer and watch football.\n\nCons (from our visit):\n-Server was initially inattentive, but came around more frequently and with a better attitude when he could tell I was frustrated.\n-\"Patriot nachos\" offered a good recipe, but lacked sufficient amount of toppings and came out room temperature.\n\nI have given Patriot the benefit of the doubt on the \"cons\", being as it was a Sunday afternoon and they had only been open for two weeks.

{"text": "#500 review!!!\n\nI've been trying to save #500 for a noteworthy contestant, but I haven't quite ran into anything outstanding for a few months :(\n\nWith that being said, my neighborhood bar/lounge recently had ANOTHER restaurant ownership change, and since it wasn't on Yelp yet, I figured I would do the honors....too bad, it's not a very positive review.\n\nFirst of all, the main reason I believe they continue having issues with the restaurant side of their business is the fact that the interior shares a half-wall with the neighboring bar which allows cigarette SMOKE to linger. It's not nearly as noticeable today in comparison to the pizza restaurant that resided a couple months ago due to the fragrant meats and sides, but still bothersome to most non-smokers.\n\nBefore I start on the food, let me first point out that this is GOOD BAR FOOD...just not great BBQ.  Let me clarify, if I was sitting at the bar watching the game, I'd be hard pressed to find much better bar counter food ordering selectively from the menu.  But compare this to the better BBQ spots in town, and you'll leave unimpressed...especially given their price point.\n\nI ordered the Combo Platter: \"Sweet\" Ribs, Pulled Pork, Smoked Beans & Mac Salad. Ribs were TERRIBLY OVERCOOKED, blackened crispy & dry. Bones were BRITTLE & actually BROKE APART when given little effort. The Pulled Pork was good though, crunchy bits and smokey undertone, with the only complaint being the sauce too SWEET for my tastes. Smoked beans were a nice change from the norm, but the mac salad was forgettable.\n\nAlso tried the Chopped Brisket, Baked Beans & Coleslaw. Brisket was DROWNED in sweet bbq sauce that masked all the smokey flavor that was hiding inside. Beans were run-of-the-mill but enjoyable.  Coleslaw tasted like raw cabbage and water.  Where is the vinegar...sugar...flavor? \n\nAnd last but not least, the Fried Pickles. Some pieces were a bit salty and overcooked, but most were tasty and well done. \n\nTo summarize, if you are in the area looking for a good place to watch the game & some good bar food (and don't mind the smoke), this would be an great choice given what we have in the Northwest.  If you are looking for the best BBQ in Vegas, you won't find it here.", "review_id": "1-h0ba1zW-wf_exl1FAQwA"}

{"text": "Since they have only been open for about a week, I'll forgive them for having run out of Brisket and Chicken.

I give the ribs 4-1/2 stars on their own, I'd give 5 if not for the high cost of a full rack.  These were cooked perfectly.  I can't think of any ribs I'd had in Las Vegas that I enjoyed as much as these.\n\nThe sliced turkey breast ordered in lieu of smoked chicken was ok, and the angus cheddar burger was good. For sides, the baked beans were very enjoyable as were the onion rings.

I did not enjoy it. The brisket was OK, the only part of the experience deserving any stars, but drenched in BBQ sauce. In Texas they let you add your own sauce. I feel like they were compensating for poor quality preparation. The Cole slaw was dry, the dressing was watery and pooled at the bottom of the cup.

{"text": "Why? Why? Why...can we not get more solid BBQ here? Has Vegas been cursed by some sort of barbecue hating devil? Have the BBQ Gods no mercy on Sin City? I really just don't get it. But before I self-explode, let me explain...\n\nBubba D's is a brand new BBQ joint located inside the Town Center Lounge on Sky Pointe, just off Ann & the 95. I'm not super familiar with this lounge, but I do know from driving by it everyday that the restaurant inside has seen its fair share of changes. Not long ago, a breakfast place used to be here that I had bookmarked, and never got to try. According to Bubba D's, they shut down due to allowing guests under 21 to dine-in. Because they share the space with a lounge who's ceilings are 28 feet high, and it's way \"too expensive\" for them to legally block off the area, this is strictly a 21 and over spot. So, for families with children, you're stuck with takeout only. I don't want to fault them much for the location, as I'm sure they're just working with what they can, but I really question why a BBQ joint would pick this spot. Even if I had been at this bar drinking beforehand, I'm not sure I would've wanted to spend that much money on what is technically just bar food. \n\nMuch like other bars, the menu is larger, this one just focuses on BBQ. Obviously there's classic choices like meat plates and sandwiches, but they also have some unique items like giant potatoes, tacos and even burritos. Tons of sides are available, although some are only available a-la carte, and there's a separate \"To Go By The Pound\" menu as well. In my opinion, pricing is flawed and kind of all over the place. A 1/2lb of brisket alone starts at $10, yet a burrito or potato that they proudly display as weighing over 1lb, with brisket, is only $12. Sure, there's other ingredients in these, but how small are they making the meat portions? And because sides are separate, most of which you can not order with the combos, the bill can get rough. We only ordered 2 combo plates with 1 dessert, no drinks or extras, and our to-go bill was just a few cents under $40. I have no problem paying for good BBQ, we all now how much meat is, but they've got a lot of work to do. Here's what we got...\n\nI'll start with sides. All borderline terrible in my opinion. The coleslaw was either packaged, or made with a very generic cookbook. No flavor at all, and way too watery. Potato salad was just as bad flavor-wise, and I swear they put rosemary in it. It just didn't work. Then sadly, my most anticipated side of all was the smoked beans, and they were probably the worse. I had to scoop some up to take the photo, but most of the container was liquid. And that liquid tasted like straight up smoke water. Imagine taking a cup of water and leaving it in a smoker for hours upon hours, then sipping on it. I love me some smokey flavor, but whoa!\n\nHoping the meat would make up for the lackluster sides, we dug in, and were let down with just about everything. I ordered a 2 meat combo with chopped brisket and sausage, Lore ordered a 2 meat with ribs and pulled pork. They don't offer a classic hot link, but do have locally sourced sausages made just for them. My pick for the sausage was jalape\u00f1o, and tasted like just about nothing. It was drowned in sauce, which is most likely why, but I'll get back to the sauce. Both the brisket and pulled pork seemed to be smoked great. The meat wasn't overly smokey, you could taste a bit of seasoning in them, and they were tender with nice little crispy burnt-endish pieces. Unfortunately, the ribs were probably the worst of all. I'm no smoking expert, but they seemed to be cooked at too high of a temperature, way too fast. The outside was burnt black, yet parts of the inside seemed undercooked. It had a raw meat look and texture. And I'm not talking about the pink from smoke rings. 80% of the rack got trashed. \n\nBut here's the thing, I can honestly say this was my first ever backwards BBQ experience. In most cases, the meat at joints is what's lacking, but you can get enough sauce on them to make it taste okay. But Bubba D's is the only place I've been too where it was the complete opposite, and I wished there was no sauce on most of the stuff, like the brisket and sausage. This sauce is bad. Really bad. I'm not sure if the photos will do it justice, but the only thing I can compare it to is some sort of old, canned marinara/pizza sauce. It's thick, it's tomatoey, and it seriously ruined every piece of meat on all our plates. The ribs couldn't be saved, so that's another story. But I'm not even sure what sauce we got either. We weren't offered a choice (even though there's 3 on the menu), and we attempted to get as much of it off the meat before we ate to try figuring it out. \n\nI hate giving places like this such a bad review, but this was just bad food. The friendly owners and service is worthy of 2 stars, but I can't say the same for the eats.", "review_id": "uJhFNTyzKushjPM-qnyVBw"}
{"text": "Dissapointing. Seeing the smoker outside we had high hopes for this new BBQ joint, boy were we let down. Meats were all overdone and dry. Beware, the meats come smothered in sauce. You have to ask for no sauce so you can sauce your own. The sauces were mediocre. My ribs were hard on the outside and not in a good way. \n Ordered both the regular and jalape\u00f1o corn bread. The regular was like a crumbly dense flavorless cake. The jalape\u00f1o was the exact same piece with a whole jalape\u00f1o cooked on top. Come on, take the time to slice up the jalape\u00f1o and mix it with some roasted corn into the batter. It tasted like Jiffy cornbread mix.\n The beans were ok. They were a bit overdone but had chunks of meat for flavor which redeemed them a little bit. The potato salad was the best thing about my dinner, on par with a store deli counter salad, didn't taste homemade. \n The waitress was sweet and I hope she finds a new job soon.

The house salad is just spring mix lettuce and balsamic dressing, which was good, but expected a little more Than just lettuce for $3. Now even though I didn't notice they forgot my meatball until home, The ravioli made up for it!(And they give you a big serving!) Absolutely delicious, you can tell everything is homemade, including the pasta. And the butter sauce was a perfect addition. it was all services with fresh garlic bread, and hit the spot perfectly! I will definitely be coming back! Hoping to try that meatball next time!! if you are thinking about it, GO! You won't be disappointed.\nUPDATE- i went back for more deliciousness and that elusive meatball. I met Emilie while there, she apologized for the forgotten meatball and gave me a half meatball sandwich on the house, and it was incredible. One of the best meatball sandwiches I've had!

It appeared that there would have been no bad seats in the theatre.\n\nThe props were stellar with ghosts coming up from the floor, even.  The performance was good with some actors performing better than others.  I especially liked the performances of Terry Wickline as both Mrs. Dilber and Mrs. Fezziwig, as well as Tim Hartman as Mr. Fezziwig and Ghost of Christmas Present.  They did their jobs especially well.  I have to say I was somewhat disappointed in the performance of the main character, Scrooge himself, as played by Tom Atkins.  I realize it was the first performance on opening night but his performance seemed a bit off, with it seeming as if he was just shouting lines at times without quite the appropriate emotion to go along with the lines.  \n\nNonetheless, it was a nice Christmas event and glad we went.", "review_id": "wW6INHDeRN6hRwSD8mPb6w"}

A large orchestra section and balcony section. My friend and I sat towards the back right orchestra. Despite our distance from the stage, we could hear all that was being said (granted, most of the cast had microphones). I'm not sure how the acoustics would have been like without the microphones.

It seems that no matter how old I get I still kind of gasp a little at the beauty of the theaters. They are so regal and timeless. We had great seats so we could take in everything-the decor and the play. \nThe story \"A Christmas Carol\" has been around a long time and it has been given different spins but it is definitely timeless. This production was done with a British flair. It was fun and funny. The characters were played well. Mr. Fuzziwig and Scrooge's housemaid were our favorite characters. They both kept us laughing with their funny lines and slapstick humor. I had kids behind me and in front of me and they were all laughing. \nTom Atkins did a wonderful job of portraying Scrooge. He was grouchy, then playful, then sad, and finally he was joyful. He played the who range of emotions and did it well. You felt sad when his fianc\u00e9 left him yet you felt happy with him when he had a change if heart and decided to be giving. \nMost of all I loved all of the Christmas carols. My tree is up at home. Stockings are hung and the nativity is on display but it wasn't until I was hearing the beautiful carols that it felt like Christmas. \nThis is a must see!

The Byham has a noticeably smaller stage than other theaters in the city, but they made the most of the area. I thought it was beautifully decorated and made be feel like I was truly in the scene with them. Costumes were great as well!\n\nThe show itself was great. It definitely exceeded my expectations. I was afraid it was going to go slow and I was going to lose interest, but they did a good job keeping things moving at a steady pace. I was particularly fond of the woman who played the maid and wife. Her performance was hilarious. She's a true comedy act! I also loved the man who played her husband (he also played a ghost I believe). Once again, so funny! I loved seeing him come out because I knew we were going to laugh. \n\nPeople are criticizing Scrooge's performance, but I thought he did good. There may have been times he could have added more to his character, but he's Scrooge. He's supposed to be bland. \n\nMy only criticism (maybe because I wasn't too familiar with the story) was that I expected there to be more music and singing. There were only a handful of times music was involved and each time it wasn't a full song. It seemed like it was more or less used to help transition scenes.

{"text": "I was lucky enough to get tickets to the show through a Yelp giveaway.  Our seats were AMAZING!  Orchestra center, about 12 rows back, you can't get much better than that!  The scenery was gorgeous I thought, and really set the mood for Victorian London.  They used the stage and scenery well and were all over stage right, left, and everywhere in between.  The costumes were well done and I loved seeing the carolers in all of the Victorian glory.  \n\nThe acting was actually pretty darn good, though I will say that some of the so called English accents were a little weak at times.  I'm pretty sure Scrooge went from English to Scottish to Australian accents many time throughout the performance.  He pretty much finished the show in a Scottish accent.  \n\nThe singing was really excellent and I loved all of the traditional carols throughout the show.  I do agree that I'm not quite sure this was considered a \"musical\" because the only singing was during transitions in the story.  The songs had nothing to do with the storyline or plot like in your traditional musical.  Still singing was excellent, just wish I had heard more of it.  Scrooge's sister had a really beautiful voice especially.\n\nMy one word of caution is that if you're bringing children, make sure they aren't especially skittish.  I'm pretty sure the 4 or 5 year old boy in front of me was scared to bejeezus when some of the ghosts came out. \n\nOverall a great Pittsburgh production and a great tradition for your family!", "review_id": "ka4AF9JlRgufrBPAlmDrsw"}

{"text": "Filip is Awesome, Very Professional, and Trustworthy!!!!! I have already given his card out to 2 friends. Please read my story below to better understand the automotive repair experience Filip provided.\n\nWhen I moved from Ohio I lost my very reliable automotive repair technician. For the past 8 yrs I have been trying to find a professional automotive (ASE certified) technician that understands what customers need. I have a 2004 Toyota Camry that was due for several automotive repairs so I took it to the local Toyota dealership to get an oil change and have them inspect the entire car to generate a list of the needed repairs. The following items were on the list:\n      Leaking High Pressure Power Steering Hose\n      Leaking Return Power Steering Hose\n      Torn Lower Control Arm Bushing on the Drivers side\n      Torn Lower Control Arm Bushing on Passengers side\n      Rear Struts leaking-Both Sides\n      Air Cabin Filter\n      4-Wheel Alignment\n\nThe price they quoted was ridiculous and was obviously out of the book used to quote how long a job takes. The worst part about dealerships is that they charge you for every hour the book quotes to make the repair even if the techs finish the job faster than the book outlined. Most repair jobs that have a repair list like above have some overlapping of hours between the jobs which is never recognized in the quote. The faster the tech gets the work completed, the more money they make(Both the Crooked Service Advisor and the technician). Also keep in mind that the massively inflated dealership repair shop rate includes profit for 4 parties(Dealership, Parts Department, Service Advisor, and Technician). After getting the list I then decided to search on craigslist in an attempt to find another reliable technician like in Ohio. Interestingly enough I noticed the Add for Flop Shop, which at first glance made me very skeptical about the place(My initial thought was chop shop?) but I figured why not just give a call and see what happens. Surprisingly, Filip answered the phone on New Years day even though Flop Shop was not open!! Yep that's right...this intrigued me enough to pursue a quote which he politely said he could give once back in the shop the following day. He did request the repair list I received from the dealership. The following morning Filip called me with a quote and I was very pleased with the pricing. Filip uses the same books to quote the hours of the work but accommodates by removing the greedy crooked other parties(Dealership, Service Advisor). Filip gets the parts directly from the manufacturers if possible so there is a lot less markup than at a dealership plus the warranties are always better. If he is unable to get the part from the manufacturer then he will search other local avenues for the new parts, even dealership parts departments, to make sure he can get your vehicle repaired in the timeframe you need. I agreed to the price and dropped the vehicle off on Saturday morning 9am. Filip outlined the level of communication he would provide throughout the day so I could stay up to date with the status of the repair, and he followed through perfectly. I always knew how the repair was coming along and when the repair was finished. In the morning Filip generated his own list of repairs and called me about what he found. Here is Filip's list of repair items:\n      Leaking LOW Pressure Power Steering Hose \n               (Dealership said it was the high pressure line which was double the cost   of the low pressure one)\n      Leaking Return Power Steering Hose\n      Torn Lower Control Arm Bushing on the Drivers side\n      Slightly Torn Lower Control Arm Bushing on Passengers side\n      Rear Struts-Weak(Not Leaking) on both sides\n      Weak Battery(Rough Starting)\n      4-Wheel Alignment\n      Broken Dog bone motor mount bushing\n\nFilip called me letting me know the changes(Low Pressure Steering hose, Battery, Motor Mount) and that the cost would not change because the combination of the Dog bone motor mount and the low pressure power steering hose equaled the cost of the high pressure steering hose. What shocked me was that the dealership didn't even noticed the completely blown out bushing on the dog bone mount and the weak battery. Filip noticed that the battery was from O-Reilly and called to see if it was a free warranty replacement and thankfully he was able to get a new battery for free saving me money and being stuck somewhere because my battery died. One of the other things you may have noticed between the lists was the exaggerations on key repairs(Leaking, etc..). Filip finished the majority of the repairs on Saturday and then had the alignment completed on Sunday. The car was repaired in the timeframe that Filip indicated and now it drives like it was new. Filip knows customers service and understands the needs of the customer. Filip is My New Automotive Repair Technician. Thank You Filip!!!!", "review_id": "xg68foPoVSoiTcy07aSQlw"}

The two home runs were the water spinach with fresh garlic and the shreaded tea smoked duck with ginger.

We were told that the chef is formerly from Sichuan Gourmet.  There are several menus including an American Chinese menu, a traditional Szechuan menu, a listing of hot pots.  We ordered from the Szechuan menu and had fish filet in spicy broth, dumplings in Szechuan sauce, double cooked pork belly and ox tongue and tripe.  The ox tongue and tripe was the most flavorful with complex Szechuan spice, but it packs a wallop of heat.  It was served cold and the meat was very tender;.  I highly recommend.  The dumplings had a mixture of chili oil and soy sauce, which made them less spicy than I had thought.  The soy sauce added a sweetness to them.  The double cooked pork was served with green peppers and leeks.  It was tasty and very mild.  (The same dish from China Star is fiery).  Finally the fish, which was Jeanette's favorite, had lots of tender filets and spice, but not the same complex spice flavor as the tongue and tripe.  There were also chunks of what I think were celery and cabbage.  There are a lot more dishes to try, and soon they will have take out.  So we plan to return.", "review_id": "bNBPx_CZyAhxhyr6JHWt_g"}

{"text": "I am proud to be the first reviewer of the brand spanking new Yard location in Tempe which, by the way, does not actually hard open until December 9, 2014.  \n\nYesterday (Wednesday, December 3, 2014), one of my buddies heard that the new Tempe location of The Yard / Culinary Dropout was open for business and asked me if I was interested in checking it out.  Being a somewhat regular patron of the location in Phoenix, and a fan of the concept in general, I happily accepted the invitation.  We rounded up another buddy, and the three of us headed to The Yard at about 5pm.   \n\nWe arrived and entered via the (wet paint) front most entrance, walked down a long corridor, and were greeted with exactly what we expected from The Yard, a very cool open space with both an interior restaurant and covered exterior patio lounge setting with Yard games and a huge bar separating the two areas.  A new addition to the concept, the massive patio space has it's own large bar at the end of the venue that can be closed off and turned into a separate private area.  There were perhaps 60-70 people milling about, dining or enjoying cocktails.  Considering that they have a capacity of nearly 800 patrons, it did not seem busy.  We sat at the bar and were greeted by a bartender -- who through a roundabout conversation told us that they were not yet open for business!   All of the people we saw eating, drinking and interacting were employees participating in real world training!   \n\n\"But\", said the bartender, \"here are some menus for you to take a look at -- hang out for just a moment and I'll be right back\".\n\nUp walks Jason, the General Manager.   Jason reiterates that the hard open is not until December 9th, but that our timing was impeccable.  \"Gentlemen, prepare yourselves to the the first real customers of the Yard and Culinary Dropout -- except with a catch...try a few of our specialty drinks, try some food, and it's all on the house tonight\".   \n\nWe were then immediately greeted by our mixologist for the evening, Nick, who spent about 2 hours with us demonstrating his amazing knowledge of everything on the food and drink menu.  \n\nWe enjoyed the following cocktails --  On the \"Two Handed Shandies\" list, the Deviant Behavior.  On the \"Classic Dropouts\" list, the Creature of Habit, Smashed Irishman and Every Which Way But Loose.  On the \"Light & Easy\" list, the My Suffering Bastard.  Each drink was perfectly balanced, and amazing.   The three of us could not find a bad word to describe these drinks.   Put them ALL on your \"Must Try\" list!  \n\nIn there somewhere, we noticed what looks like a \"Jameson\" beer tap handle with a big red Christmas bow on it.   Inquiring minds must know!!!  Result:  We were each treated to a rocks glass of the Culinary Dropout's very own Christmas Jameson blend.   Think Fireball....except more refined, more upscale, more sophisticated.  Sexier.  This will blow your taste buds away as you sip it. PUT THIS ON YOUR \"MUST TRY\" LIST!  \n\nAlso between other beverages, we were each treated to a sampling of the ON TAP Pinot Grigio.  Very cool concept, and quite a good wine with a somewhat sweet aroma and a nice balanced finish.  The ladies will love this.   \n\nDuring all of this amazing cocktail time, Nick took the opportunity to put us together a massive Antipasti board.   We received a huge portion of hot capicola and jamon iberico off the meats list.  From the cheese list, the truffled crescenza, the prarie breeze cheddar along with a few accouterments.  From the snacks list, the toasted ciabatta, garlic oil & balsamic.  The iberico is imported from Spain and it is expensive.  My girlfriend was in Madrid last month and returned with some iberico (oops -- sorry US Customs!), so I knew we were getting a treat.  We were not disappointed!  Nick even schooled us on the very expensive precision machine used to slice the meats.  All I can say is...what an experience!   \n\nTo top it all off, we received a basket of the (now famous) soft pretzels & house made provalone fondue. I have to believe this will be their single most ordered item.  Recreate this exact spread we received and you'll not go away hungry!   \n\nIn close -- Tempe will love this place.  The sister location in Phoenix is wildly popular, and I fully expect that this new location in Tempe will have the effect of bringing just the right blend of the college contingent and the 20-40's crowd from Tempe.  Sam Fox is a genius for picking this location.   \n\nJason the GM had a choice when my friends and I walked in last night thinking The Yard was open for business.  He could have asked us to come back once they were open and we would have understood -- but instead he treated us to an extremely unique experience that we will not forget -- and we hope that they will not forget us.  \n\nWe will be back, probably on December 9, and we will bring friends!", "review_id": "0Ubz7JEedNjjB6DiSdmkwg"}
{"text": "I was the other patron with Scott M who wrote the first review. He went into great detail of our experience so I will limit mine. All I have to say is the drinks were amazing. The smashed irishman was an awesome drink. I love how balanced and uniquely crafted the drinks were. They go into great detail when making these drinks and they could be loaded with various types of spirits and you would not have a clue what was in it. Everything balances out to bring a wonderful drink to your mouth. Nick was our bartender and he was on top his game. He answered all the hard questions we through at him and explained all the different items on the menu both food and drink. Jason the GM was great as well. Very thankful for him to give us the ultimate VVIP (very very important person) experience before they were even open to the public. The soft opening is tonight and the hard opening is December 9th. I'll be back on December 9th with friends and other family members to say hello to Nick and Jason and enjoy some great food and amazing drinks and toss a few bags around as well. \n\nThis is going to be a great hit for Tempe. It will bring a nice diverse crowd and not so much the college scene as it will be for everyone. Keep in mind its no longer referred to as Mill Ave but now \"Downtown Tempe\" with new businesses going up just off Mill Ave such as Postino's, east of Mill and now The Yard and The Lodge west of Mill. It's more of a district that you can enjoy vs a single strip of bars. \n\nLastly, parking is not an issue here. This is a huge bonus for them with an adjacent lot that has 800 parking spots available which is free after 4pm. You can easily park, play, eat and go home. No fighting for traffic spots and walking a distance to get to your destination.", "review_id": "_A8ACgpNGHY2e1aCNX1Jgg"}

Also, there were many tables if you'd prefer to sit down and have a meal. There were plenty of games to play and televisions if you're into watching a game.

We ordered food, and the food came out before my glass of water that I had ordered from our server. And, it took almost 20 minutes between her grabbing our card and check off of the table to bringing it back to us to sign and leave. \n\nI'll definitely be coming back though.

Larger restaurant, TWO bars, and an additional lounge area with fire pits (fun in the winter). They also had some excellent musicians playing live which is always good. Ambiance was amazing...decor and design of the restaurant was impressive as I've come to expect from Fox restaurants. It's a bit too far away from Mill Avenue to be considered walking distance, but for me that was a plus. \nNegatives? Beer selection was pretty limited. Lame. They really push the specialty cocktails, which is all fine and dandy, but sometimes a girl just wants a good amber-style beer. Is that too much to ask? (Yes, at The Yard, apparently it is.) Also, place closes on weekdays at 11, Saturdays at 1 and Sundays at 10. What is the point of shutting down before 2am? Doesn't make a ton of sense to me as you're marketed as a restaurant and BAR.

(They have several games for customers including a cool grass turf area with bean bags and several ping pong tables as well).  My toddlers loved it!\n\nIn addition to great ambiance, I found the staff at this latest FRC concept to be super friendly and attentive, and the food was awesome too!\n\nI ordered an egg white frittata for myself - it was huge, healthy, filling and I loved it!  The kids shared an order of chicken tenders and fries and The Yard's famous Captain Crunch coated French Toast.  Jared and his dad had Fried Chicken and Biscuits... needless to say, all was filling and we left with full bellies.\n\nGotta love a restaurant that caters to college kids, adults, and is family-friendly in addition.

{"text": "Over rated hype.\nI have been here twice now, and both times I found the food to be average at best. \nThe first time I went, it was very busy, and it was like watching someone herd cats when it came to getting the orders out to people.\nThe restaurant is small, and gets real small with the crowd that has been there of late. You can get a few people in line to order, but then there is a massive group standing around waiting at a small counter for their food. \nThe drive-thru is always long, and in my 2nd trip there, I did use the drive-thru and watched people who would enter the place after I already placed my order, walk up, order, get their food and leave before I even went up 1 spot. \nSo my advice is go inside if it is a slower period in the day.\nThe food was OK. I had a chicken sandwich, that I have had better at other places, and some really nasty greasy chicken strips. It was hard to tell if the juice coming from strip was grease of juice from the chicken. I am missing something here with this chain and their food because I found it to be OK. \nThe staff working the counter was really seemed to be in a hurry the whole time I was ordering. Once my order was placed, I was told to stand to the right for my food, yet the person bringing it to me was coming from the left. Like I said before, herding cats. \nThe drive-thru person was just as useless it seemed to me. I handed her my credit card, she dropped it, I had to pull forward and stand at the drive-thru window to pay for my order. I could have gone inside and done this if I wanted to get out of my car. While standing there, she was telling the manager that I dropped the card and was the reason for the hold up. \nThis place should be getting a 1 star, but solo because it was not the worst experience I have ever had, and because the 1st time I went in it was REALLY busy, I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt. But the drive-thru experience was totally uncalled for, and really should have me giving this place a 0 star. \nI know this is a fast food joint. I know there is a stereotype that comes with the workers at fast food joints, but I would like to think that this place would break the mold and have people working there that know their left from there right, know how to grab something, and know not to b.s about something in front of the customer. \nFool me once.....", "review_id": "3863pWUY8cVyxM1WRCUbQw"}

I opted for the drive-thru, since at least I could wait in the comfort of my car, and carefully navigated entering the lane from the mall frontage road -- let's just say, some folks are not too good at this kind of thing, and it gets a little tight in there.  However, once the line split into two lanes, it was smooth sailing, and the order-taker was, if possible, even friendlier than I remember from Memphis.  She even took my name for the order, which was then confirmed at the pick-up window where my food was ready and waiting.  Most impressively, my order was exactly was I'd requested, down the sauce (they often forgot that in Memphis...), and my milkshake sans whipped cream and cherry (which I was asked when I ordered).\n\nAnd the food, of course, was fabulous.  I'm embarrassed to admit how quickly I wolfed it down...  I've yet to encounter a better milkshake, my chicken strips were amazingly tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside, and the fries were...well, they were fine.  I dearly miss their short-lived sweet potato fries, and it would be the highlight of my year if they would bring them back, but alas, I think I'm out of luck on that one.\n\nThus, I'm happy to report that this outpost of Chick-fil-A more than lives up to its name.  Take it from a semi-Southerner, you've gotta try it!", "review_id": "ANHeWW0wzU7VbNqPV3bSig"}

I was so excited when they opened one 5 min from my house!  Stopped by the day after their grand opening and was almost deterred by the crowd.  Convinced my husband to stick it out with me.  Surprisingly the massive line took no time to get through and I got my chick fil a!  This is the only fast food restaurant I ever eat at.

{"text": "Damn Homie.  This chicken is good.\n\nI had Chick-fil-A for the first time a few years ago in Kansas City.  My wife kept telling me it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, so I had to give it a shot.  It was pretty good, not the most amazing chicken ever but very good, and the service at that location was fantastic.  The manager personally took us under his wing and made us feel like we were both appreciated and at a real restaurant.  Needless to say, for a fast food chain I was more than impressed.\n\nWell, now Madison has a Chick-fil-A.  I went on opening day to give it another shot, and they had both the service and crowd under control.  They had brought in employees from some of their southern stores and were actually assisting people with traffic, the drive through, you name it.  I've never seen something like this for a fast food chain, they realized how popular it would be and planned appropriately.  That's not to say there weren't a million people trying to get there, but the lines flowed smoothly and soon enough I had my delicious chicken strips, sandwhich and waffle fries.\n\nIf there's anything to knock, it's that the menu is pretty limited.  The food I mentioned above is just about all there is to it.  They have shakes as well, they're pretty solid.  But that chicken.  Oh man is it good.  Fresh taste, not some KFC \"what did I just eat\" mess.  It's uber tasty.  \n\nSadly, as much as I planned to just \"give them a chance\", I found myself there the next 3 days straight.\n\nRuh Roh.  #TastyHeartAttack\n\nP.S.

{"text": "When you look hard enough, there are some amazing mom & pop shops to be found in Las Vegas. Although a bit different, as this is more of a mom & daughter team, Gotta Love Cheesecake is a truly one of a kind spot...\n\nThe owners, mom Kathy, and daughter Heidi moved to Las Vegas from Michigan to make reality of their mother/grandmothers dream to open a bakery. They've set up shop in the Northwest part of the valley just off Ann & Rainbow. In fact, this review is a little bittersweet for me as they've taken over the exact same spot where Legends Cafe used to be. Sadly another great mom & pop that shut down due to complaints from neighboring residents. But luckily, Gotta Love Cheesecake aren't going to be running a smoke pit outside and are hopefully here to stay!\n\nIf the name didn't give it away, this shop is a bakery that focuses much of its attention on fresh, scratch made cheesecakes. Over 25 flavors are available, including seasonal selections, and they rotate daily. They come standard in a 4\" personal size for $5.95, but can also be custom ordered in a couple different larger sizes (8\", 9\" & 10\"). For custom orders, they only ask for 24 hours advanced notice, and while not directly advertised, Kathy & Heidi said they'll also do just about flavor request, even off the menu.\n\nNow, if you're looking for something made in a factory, frozen, shipped and then thawed on location *ahem Cheesecake Factory*, this isn't the place for you. Every cheesecake is scratch made from bottom to top. Starting with the crust, which I think is a signature for them. It's thick, buttery and adds bother flavor and texture to the cheesecakes. The filling itself is silky, smooth and has the perfect creamy texture. It's also very flavorful, especially when you go with something more bold, like the chocolate mint. And depending on what you order, you'll get even more flavor with yup, you guessed it, scratch made toppings. You can really taste the love, and respect the time they put into their classic family recipes. \n\nWhat's even more exciting, at least for cheesecake or even overall sweets lovers like me, is that they're continuously looking to branch out with new flavors. Rumor has it there might be something with maple, maybe even a bacon & maple on the horizon. I may or may not have it had a little influence on that one. ;)\n\nGotta Love Cheesecake isn't only making spectacular cheesecakes either. They also rotate different daily treats including scratch made cookies, dessert rolls and other baked goods. And if that weren't enough, they also serve up coffee and over half a dozen fresh loose leafed teas. Top all that off with some of the absolute friendliest service you can find, and a nice homey feeling little shop, this is a must try spot, regardless what side of town you're coming from.", "review_id": "GOgfPzO1kwyggnhUo21LPQ"}

The pulled pork was a disaster. The appearance should have been warning enough - unappetizing looking slop. The taste? I am sure there was pork in there as I got a very faint hint of smokiness from time to time. However, other than a somewhat stringy texture amongst the overwhelming flavor of sugar it could have been anything. Did I mention the overly sweet sugar taste? That was all you got.

The amazing team behind Blackstrap BBQ, the only authentic slow smoked Texas style BBQ in the city, finally brings delicious burritos to Montreal's  food scene. All of their mission style burritos are great, but special mention has to be given to the brisket, slow smoked from Blackstrap and flavoured with a Mexican twist. You can't go wrong with whatever you order and I have been back several times to check each burrito off my to-do list. The perfect marriage of BBQ and Mexican Burritos, Tejano, which means a Texan of Spanish or Mexican decent, honours its name and heritage.", "review_id": "AqSdc13P-XxvdyKxQDtpzg"}
{"text": "My first experience of what I would qualify as true BBQ occurred a few years ago now when Blackstrap BBQ opened down in Verdun. I remember hearing about this new Southern BBQ joint opening and being interested enough to go on the first Friday they were open - getting in just before they ran out of meat - and being in awe of the level of smokiness and juiciness that the crew achieved with their meats. From that moment on, it was pretty clear to me that I would go whenever Dylan Kier and his pit mastery would go next. That thought process is what brought me a few times over the past month to his most recent project, a small burrito joint called Tejano BBQ Burrito.\n\nLocated in St-Henri right beside Bar de Courcelles and nearby many of my favorite different culinary spots - quick shout out to Campinelli, Rustique, Leche and Grumman 78 - Tejano feels primarily set up as a take out joint although there is a small sitting area with about 7 stools. The space is sparse - plain white walls with old partially sanded down wood used for the counters. Some smooth laid back music in the background. The menu printed on paper tacked above the ordering counter. The look is definitely in keeping with its older brother Blackstrap BBQ - functional and sparse with just enough of a style and vibe keeping with a southern BBQ joint.\n\nBut let's be honest - you don't go to a Burrito space for the decor. It's all about the food of course. At present, the menu is short and concise - burritos (regular and XL sized), tostadas, salads, guac, salsa and chips. For the burritos and tostadas, there are 3 meat options (smoked chicken tinga, chorizo pulled pork, rancho cumin brisket) and one vegetarian (black beans and hominy). Once you make your selection of a base, you can add either re-fried beans, black beans and hominy (if you went with a meat) and/or rice then a collection of different vegetables (pico de gallo, red onions, radishes, jalape\u00f1os, peppers, corn, etc...) followed by cheese, fresh lime juice, house guacamole, hot sauce and/or sour cream.\n\nIn terms of the burritos, all those options leave you with a fully stuffed burrito and a rather filling one as well. I tried both the pulled pork and the brisket options in burrito form. In keeping with Dylan's work at Blackstrap BBQ, the quality of the meats is impeccable. The pulled pork has that little heat from the chorizo and is wonderfully tender and juicy. The brisket is the same with just a subtle touch of the cumin which gives off a smokier element than the pork. In terms of the other ingredients, I enjoyed both bean options although I'm not sure I would enjoy a black bean and hominy burrito on its own - a meatless burrito just seems wrong to me. All the vegetables are fresh and crisp. Loved the creaminess of the guacamole although I'm not a huge fan of it being the only ingredient that costs extra to add in. Overall, excellent burritos that would be a regular lunch option for me if I worked anywhere nearby (which I don't sadly in this case).\n\nThe new menu item for me here was the Tostada which I had never heard of before. Basically, a burrito bowl - all the same ingredients pilled over top a crispy tortilla shell. The crisp shell was good but honestly, other than the texture change with that crispiness, it's not all that different from the burrito. A different presentation but given how I loved the burritos, I think I'll stick to those personally.\n\nReasonable price, good quality and quantity of food and quick service - All in all, Dylan, Clara and Co. have a great concept going with Tejano BBQ Burrito. It has only been open for about a month now but given what I've enjoyed, I suspect we will hear about this spot a lot more and very quickly in this new year. That particular corner of St-Henri is quickly becoming one of my favourite areas to enjoy food wise... I think i'll be visiting even more often in 2015!\n\nCheers!", "review_id": "VegFMkXrzC4nRMqoC3uV9w"}

Paired with roasted garlic, toasty bread, and cucumbers, it was definitely worth it! My carbonara was also delicious. The eggs wre a bit more raw than I like, but I also don't usually go for runny eggs with brunch so I'm probably in the minority there. The bacon was awesome, and the arugala was a great touch! Tried the fig and gorgonzola, and it would be perfect for those who love the combo of savory and sweet. Not my jam, but I still enjoyed it regardless!

The bar area is a little cramped, but I think they've done really well provided the space.\n\nWe had a house salad, with a pesto-y vinaigrette and tons of veggies (radishes, beets, cukes, mixed greens, etc.). Very fresh. Perfect start to a meal.\n\nWe ordered the Jalape\u00f1o Asesino pizza. Omg. Fresh jalape\u00f1os, chorizo, chicken, a kind of chimichurri-style sauce drizzled on top...super flavorful, and with that perfect level of heat that doesn't blow out your taste buds, but builds slowly on your tongue.

So, I was really thankful to visit on a weekday, when I didn't need to wait for seats, and food didn't take too long to arrive. If you're lost, it's right next to Johnson Public House, and have pizza board with skulls saying Wisco on them (So hipster :p)!\n\nThe menu has great selections - lots of appetizers, make your own pizza, specialty pizza and tacos!!! Pretty excited about all these things. Also, there's a good selection of beer and non-alcoholic drinks. \n\nI loved the carbonara pizza - eggs, bacon, cheese. my FAVORITE THINGS. AND, how is it possible that ALL 3 eggs were RUNNY. Such an amazing creamy, rich flavor with runny yolks! The crust of the pizza is thin crust, though not italian thin, but has great chew to it. (P.S. the ~8\"/$14 pizza was so big, we had some leftovers; the leftovers were AMAZING. just heat them up in the oven. oooohhhhh good)\n\nWe also tried the bacon and cheese bread (even though it was similar to our pizza..), the sriracha sauce added some much flavor and depth!

The egg on it was perfectly done, which is an accomplishment.\n\nThe beer list is great for such a small place. They have a lot of local crafts, as well as craft beers from other places in the Midwest (Three Floyds, Founders, ect.) \n \nThe only reason I can't quite give the place 5 stars yet is the atmosphere. It is a cramped place which is too bad because I'm sure it is only going to get busier. We had to wait 1 hour on a Tuesday (which turned out to be actually shorter than waits at other pizza places in town that night).

I have heard all about Salvatore's but I'd never tried it before, the Sun Prairie location is just too far out of the way for me. But the people there must have heard me (and other pizza-lovers like me!!), and so they open an outlet here. Thanks to my co-worker I got to know about their opening and off we went on their second day. \n\nFor being a new place they were pretty busy. It was a nice and cozy restaurant on the east side (about 7 or so tables with a small bar area). Ordered the popular Carbonara pizza and it didn't disappoint. Runny egg yolks (3 eggs!!) and smooth egg whites right on top of the pizza. With mushrooms and bacon. With all the eggs on the pizza the crust is still super crispy. Enjoyed every moment of it. The small pizza was enough to share between two people. \n\nBut we were greedy so we also had the bruchetta as the appetizer.

It's closer to a margarita in how the cheese sits next to the sauce, and that's the real winner: the flavorful sauce. The tomato pie is very well balanced, much less greasy than Glass Nickel's and much lighter on the cheese (around the same price, not a \"cheap\" pie). I will still be back again and again.\n\nWent on a Friday night and it was absolutely packed. Hard-to-get-in-and-out-of-the-door packed.

{"text": "It's an interesting concept: A sushi restaurant that plays loud Mexican music and has banks of big-screen TVs showing sporting events, a holdover from its former life as a sports bar. Interesting, but it doesn't quite gel.\n\nThe sushi was good. The servers were friendly and attentive. The service was fast on our first visit; slower on our second.\n\nIf you are a vegetarian as I am, you might want to ask yourself \"Why am I going to a sushi restaurant?\" before walking in the door. The menu has almost nothing without fish or other meat. But the server said they would be happy to customize a dish for me, which I greatly appreciated. I ordered the California Roll without crab meat. That's cucumber, avocado, and rice. Not as flavorful as their regular dishes, perhaps. But you become accustomed to making sacrifices when you're a fish out of water, so to speak.\n\nOne of the few other vegetarian offerings on the menu was an edamame appetizer. I ordered it thinking it would be healthy, but it was doused in salt. I don't even want to know how much sodium I ingested.\n\nThe big horseshoe bar from the former sports bar is still there, but no one was sitting at it. The big patio in front of the restaurant is nice and has one fire pit.\n\nIf this restaurant sounds intriguing, I suggest you go there as soon as possible. I can't imagine it will be open a year from now. The people who run the place are trying. They really are. I suspect Senor Sushi's original restaurant in Phoenix is successful.

{"text": "Had been hoping for a good sushi restaurant in our little town, but once again, CG has worked its dark magic & given me yet another reason to head to Phoenix. The service was seriously lacking, the menu had no drinks listed (not even soda) and the 2 menus my bf and I received were both printed differently. To continue the inconsistent theme, all of my BFs food came out at once; the rice came out last WTH, 5 minutes later PART of mine arrived, then we had to remind the waitress that I had also ordered miso soup ( which should've come out before any of the sushi). Once all that was taken care of, my bf instantly noticed the over sized slices of salmon on his roll. While more is usually a good thing, if you can't  consistently slice fish (or any food for that matter) you have NO business being a sushi chef. The thick slices threw off the flavor consistency of the roll, and he didn't even finish his food; which has never happened at a sushi restaurant... Ever! He said the flavor was OK, not bad, but the whole experience was \"just off\" and \"not right\". My Caramelo roll tasted good, but it wasn't even sliced all the way thru, so ever other time I picked up a bite, it unwrapped the next piece.  I ended up cutting the damn thing with a fork! That chef needs to go back to school and work on his knife skills PRONTO! This all happened at 2pm, so it's not as if they were busy at all. Just like every thing else in Casa Grande, Senor Sushi suffers from laziness. This town has a long way to go. Nothing will ever improve if the people don't take pride in what they do; no matter how big or small the job.

Next up was a stir fry loaded with vegetables and tempeh, a soy product.

What a warm, lively, fun, creative and delicious way to spend a chilly Sunday night! \nI'm going to try to write this review without using too many exclamation marks, but that'll be a challenge. \nDanielle, the glowing hostess, was on fire in the kitchen! I mean, she whipped up individual stir fry plates for every single guest (and there were a lot of us), hot and beautifully presented. And, THOSE PEANUTS. Seriously - I don't even really like peanuts but I was even grabbing a handful on my way out the door despite being already painfully full. Where were they from again?? Also, it'd been a while (like many, many years) since I'd had tempeh, and I now feel like I've been missing out! I'm definitely going to go back to check out Noble Bean, our tempeh supplier for the night, housed just upstairs from Cuisine Culinaire. Who knew?! Now we do. \nInstead of waiting in line for stir fry, I decided to go to dessert first and sample some of the cookies brought in for the swap... and really didn't even know where to begin with those... There were sooooo many good cookies and such a variety. Thankfully I had my partner with me so that I could just take a bite of one to sample it and hand off the rest to him to finish for me. Ha! Cookies for days. What a FABULOUS idea to have a cookie swap. Everybody got to leave with something. :)\nNow, Cuisine Culinaire is one of over a thousand community kitchens in Quebec, so we were told, and this blows my mind! Quebec wins!

Let's just say that I was really glad to hear the muffled sound of laughter of my Yelper friends celebrating behind the doors of Centrale Culinaire! \n\nUpon entering, you could smell the rich fragrance of freshly roasted peanuts used in a sauce that accentuated a vegetarian stir fry dish that everyone enjoyed - so much that the plates were wiped clean! Meanwhile had the chance to stand, sit and walk around to reconnect with some familiar faces and got to meet new +1 friends (hopefully soon to be avid yelpers)!\n\nTo conclude the evening, we probably all ingested more than our recommended daily allowance of sugar, butter and flour by systematically going from plate to plate, alternating between cookie and a drink, to decide which was the best cookie - but heck, it was so worth it! Others were a little bit more shrewd and dove in, like an eagle, swiping a sample of each cookie and bringing the loot back to their lair and split the cookies amongst their team. Candy canes were dropped into cups of cookie favorites and a winner was crowned! \n\nRisa, thank you for organizing this memorable evening; once again kudos for originality!

Every bite was delicious and fresh, and I now know I am missing peanut butter sauce in my life. But there were so many cookies to sample!\n\nI shall never pass on cookies and made it my duty to try each and every one! I still have some tucked away in the fridge!\nMany thanks to Danielle and Risa for the event, as well as to all the fellow Yelpers who contributed to the desert!", "review_id": "nEh6hxYbQZmY8d_RonSDaw"}
{"text": "how to review this, i'm literally cookie burnt.. haven't touch any of the leftover nor do I feel like talking about it.\n\nso yelp mtl was hosting an intimate holiday dinner at centrale culinaire to finish off 2014 in the nicest of way. our lovely hostess for the night, Danielle, welcomed us in the best possible way ever, with a lovely smell emaning from the kitchen while smiling like a kid that just saw that cookie table. we were in for a treat.\n\nmeal wise, it was vegetarian/vegan. something light, fresh, vibrant and packing some intense flavor. we started off with a very vibrant and fresh salad. the Sudanese peanuts, like Danielle said, was indeed the little something special. and since one yelper baked a savory cookie, one had to try it with the salad. not only for extra texture but to see if they'd go well with it. it did. you had the slight cheesy component but then, the burst of flavor from the fennel seed. matchmade in heaven with the salad. \n\nfor main, we had some saut\u00e9 or wok work. tempeh over a bed of stirred rice, beans and a peanut sauce. I wished portions were bigger but then, we wouldn't have any space left for the cookie bake off competition.\n\nwe had lots of cookies. every challenger had to bake 2 dozens and we were like 20 challengers.. what was a light lovely meal ended up being one hell of a cookie overdose! diabetic beware! and a lot of us decided to make chocolate chip or any chocolate variant cookies.. including myself. the winning cookie, apple dry raisin cookie was moist and so ever lovely. all that was missing was some coffee, tea or maybe a bubbly. we did had wine though. plenty of it as well as beers. from a quick count, we most likely had enough for at least half a bottle of red each.. the event only lasted 2hr. if it lasted any longer, we would probably went through all the wine and beer and some might have end up naked or something lol.\n\nI wished the event would have last longer. seeing some dear yelpers one haven't seen in a long while was indeed nice. spending more time talking while enjoying some wine and slowly going through the cookies would have made a great final 2014 event. 2hr with that many cookies and with that much wine and beer, way too short ;p", "review_id": "YitDu29r4DOYCuamr2cpaw"}

A few days later, I went to return the clock and they informed me that they have a no return policy.  They said it was posted by the register.  I explained to the owner that it was extremely busy the evening I purchased it and did not see the return policy, nor did anyone inform me of it.

{"text": "Not all that long ago this restaurant used to be called Hot Feel, but it shuttered its doors after not even a year in business serving delicious lamb skewers and spicy boiled crawfish.  So when I heard my friend said that there is a new restaurant there with a logo of a lady as part of the signage, my first thought was that it could be China Mama's second location.  But obviously that's not the correct guess.  \n\nLiang's Kitchen \u6881\u5abd\u5abd\u5bb6 (literal translation is Liang Mama's House), with the logo of the founder/matriarch of the restaurant incorporated into the signage (now in her 80s), is a Taiwanese comfort food restaurant chain from California and New York.  With locations in many of the Cali cities that I have previously lived or worked at before my move to Sin City.  So it was a surprise and reality check to see some of the cities listed (Cupertino, Fremont, Milpitas).  But I have been out here a relatively long time and those locations could have opened after I had already settled here.\n\nThe interior of this Liang's Kitchen still retained the majority of the interior design concepts custom built for the previous restaurant entity. albeit with small but noticeable additions.  The inclusion and prominent display of vintage Flying Tigers* aviator jackets (very very cool and most people will likely not know anything about its history) high up on the wall with lighting to draw the attention of anyone bothering to quickly survey the restaurant.  Plus there are WWII and Vietnam War era model fighter planes delicately hung from the ceiling in sortie formation (neato!).  \n\n* 1st American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force in 1941-1942, nicknamed the Flying Tigers, was composed of pilots from the United States Army Air Corps, Navy, and Marine Corps. (Copy & Paste excerpt from Wiki)  \n\nThe menu is extensive and following recent Chinese restaurant menu design practices, especially from abroad, looks like a sales catalog with professionally shoot images of some of the menu items, with alternating pages of straight up advertising.  It looks good, but it also has one very annoying attribute or lack thereof, which is the absence of any menu prices.  [Insert comment about if you have to ask about the price, you can't afford it. -Smirk face-]  I know from the restauranteur's perspective it makes sense and saves money in the long run, since they don't have to reprint the menu or have those tacky stickers every time there is a revision to menu pricing.  There is a separate menu sheet that does have the menu items and pricing, but no pictures.  So if you have the patience for it, you can practice cross referencing the main menu with the supplemental menu and other printouts.  Happy. Happy. Joy. Joy!\n\nFood wise, I really liked the Beef and Tendon Soup Noodle that I ordered.  It is definitely ranked in the top two on my list for this item in Las Vegas.  The noodles are the thick chewy handmade variety from Northern China. The beef tendon was cooked long enough so that it is soft and very enjoyable to eat.  The broth is flavorful without being greasy.  The Lamb skewers was good, but I thought it was a bit pricey.  Their lunch box items has a good variety of pickled vegetables and 1 entire soy sauced egg along with rice and whatever protein you selected (I ordered the Taiwanese fried port cutlet for my friend, she ate everything and liked it except for the pork - too greasy).\n\nService was good.  However, being a new restaurant with new staff, they are still not completely familiar with the pages and pages of menu items.  But as far as refilling drinks, being friendly, it was good.\n\nI will definitely be back to explore more of their menu.  However, considering the dreary weather, I may not get past their noodles section until late February.\n\n4 stars! And best of luck to the latest Taiwanese restaurant to open in Las Vegas.", "review_id": "0QM2yvHp44DYeotSxDk5ng"}
{"text": "Was in the mood for home cooked Chinese food and randomly searched \"Chinese Food\" near this area. I recognized Liang's Kitchen from the other chains I've been to.  The location can be difficult to find for the first time. The main entrance to the plaza is on spring mountain road, and it's located in the Arville Square Plaza. The restaurant sits way back in the plaza, perpendicular to most of the other stores. We ordered 4 individual dishes and an appetizer: beef noodle soup, beef tendon noodle soup, pork chop rice bento, pork chop noodle soup, and wonton in chili oil.  Everyone was happy with their order, but the only thing I'd recommend is asking the cook to separate the pork chop from the soup to prevent sogginess. The portions were decently sized (I couldn't finish my bowl of noodles), and the staff is really nice. I asked for extra small side veggies that came with some of our dishes and the staff had no problem giving us more. Overall, clean restaurant, plenty of seats, nice decor, pretty good tasting Chinese food, and well priced (our bill was around $41 sans tax).  There's plenty of other options for Chinese food around here but this is definitely a place we would come back to!", "review_id": "r07mcHdZB6p94u4ydDAnYA"}
{"text": "Was at dinner the other day with my friend and she mentioned how a new taiwanese place opened. She said the name was something kitchen... and it reminded me of Liang's Kitchen in San Jose when i went up there in 2011. Then she looked it up, and confirmed it was Liang's Kitchen. My face with from :o to *_* Lol ! Was so excited for the next few days (Thurs to Sun... so 3 days) to go try it out ! I remembered the location i went to was super busy, their beef noodle soup was amazing, served hot in a metal bowl. Their noodles were hand-made, varying size showing it was not machine made. Been wanting to go back since every time i go up to the Bay but never had the chance !\n\nSo it opened in Vegas... Finally a new Taiwanese place ! and its one i recognize ! w00t ! It sits on the north end of the complex, on the NE corner of Spring Mountain and Arville, replacing what used to be called Hot Feel. Minimal renovations were done after the take over of the unit with some reorganization of some tables. \n\nThe menu and ordering paper is about the same, if not the same as other locations. Price wise, i dont remember. Came to try this place with a few friends for dinner. We had initially ordered a few things. 1 Beef Roll, 1 Green Onion Pancake, and 2 Large Beef Tendon Noodle Soup (later i realized the L/R next to the name was large and regular NOODLES, not the size of the order OOPS hahaha o well)\n\nBeef Roll and Green onion pancake came out first\n\nGreen Onion Pancake - normal green onion pancake but fried? (is that the right term). The exterior was crispy, interior was soft and hot ! Not a fan of the fried version after a previous experience at another restaurant, but this was really good ! Especially since it was fresh and HOT ! :D i liked it \n\nBeef Roll - Essentially a green onion pancake wrap with braised beef, cilantro, and hoisin sauce. Not as hot as i had expected in comparison to the green onion pancake. I had ate the green onion pancake first so i thought this was going to be as hot. Overall, not bad. Not too sweet and overpowering by the sauce. Fairly nice balance. We had ordered this another time after and crispy exterior on the 2nd order was flaking off. Looked a bit ugly. XD (being called high maintenance for stating this... T_T)\n\nBeef Tendon Noodle Soup - We had ordered 2 with large noodles. 1 came out first before the other. The first order, as large as i had remembered. Lots of noodles, in a large metal bowl. Lots of preserved veggies and stuff on top. 2nd one, not so much... Amount of noodles was probably 1/2 of the first order. Inconsistency? Maybe. Didn't matter too much since we were sharing so the noodles were fairly split anyway, so not so bad overall, but still, a bit weird to have varying amounts on the same table. Flavor wise, pretty good ! Large noodles were uneven (lol as expected of handmade) and al dente ! The noodles were actually a LOT larger and wider than i had expected (to be honest, i dont remember how it was in San Jose). In a small sharing bowl, putting like 3 strands of noodles fills it up. Thats how big the noodles were. Beef was tender. Tendon was soft. Flavor overall was nice. A little sour kick (from the preserved vegetables probably). Next time, i wanna try the regular noodles. Memory is failing me XD\n\nShanghai? style wonton - friend wanted to order this. Small wontons (maybe 10-15 in an order) in a seaweed soup broth Nothing too special. So recognizable amount of shrimp in the wonton (not sure if shanghai style has shrimp? HK style certainly does). Wasn't a favorite but at least we've tried it? Lol\n\nServers tend to speak to you in mandarin (3 out of the 5 of us spoke cantonese. 1 of the 2 mandarin speakers didnt pay attention). yeah we fail rofl. Overall, not too bad. \n\nWould love to come back to try other things. I believe they have lunch specials as well. Prefer to have had them open in a different location but oh well.", "review_id": "X1OWHCXVAd74vTWjWzFpHA"}

I have searched far and wide going to various restaurants. \n\nSo, my friends and I went and ordered green onion pancake, beef noodle soup, and green onion pancake with beef. I liked the green onion pancake. It was really delicious and flakey. I did like the one from Easy Earthen in California better, but this is pretty good for Vegas. \n\nThe beef noodle soup was amazing! I think it might just be my favorite. The beef is so tender and soft. I love the broth. It was very flavorful, and wasn't watered down. I would say this is best beef noodle soup I have ever had. \n\nService was a little slow here. It might be because the set up is  little difficult to see people because of the huge walls between each booth. I guess they didn't want to spend money remodeling the place. \n\nThe only downside is that they don't have shanghai dumplings. I was so disappointed. :(", "review_id": "czAk-u8mXwb7yo8VD03IaA"}

Seems to be the case whether they have a lot of customers or if we're the only ones. \n\nFound a piece of plastic in my soup with the seaweed. Sighs.

{"text": "If you plan on consuming alcohol here be sure you have a horizontal valid drivers license. The concept of TopGolf is cool but this review I primarily to say customer service was not the best and very inconsistent. The point system is messed up and doesn't read properly. Here is my story: I walked in with my fianc\u00e9 and some family members. After being told it was a 3 hour wait for our bay we decided to get some food and drinks. Everyone was carded and received the drinks we ordered, we then also ordered some food. We received a text that our bay was ready way before 3 hours. As we are about to head to our bay our food comes. No one offered to deliver our food and we also were charged more for our bill (later we were charged properly). We go up to our bay and ordered some drinks for while we play. The waitress tells my fianc\u00e9 that she can not serve her alcohol because her VALID US DRIVERS LICENSE is past 30 days from when she turned 21. (Our licenses do not expire until 2019 so there is no need to get a horizontal license and we have been receiving alcohol our entire vacation). The managers eventually came and were very rude about the situation. Our group understands the drinking laws of Arizona but our point is we were literally served alcohol earlier in our visit to TopGolf. In the end it was a lot of fun besides the first hour we spent there. The place is super disorganized and needs a to understand the concept of customer service. Our point is make the rules of the establishment consistent in the entire building. If you have made it this far, thanks for reading. If you are an employee of TopGolf please do not contact me as I am uninterested in any thing you have to say.\n\nTaren, I understand that it's a law by the state of Arizona but our point is you DID serve us with our vertical IDs just moment before we went upstairs.", "review_id": "M2-fevrUnTA7FsBA7x4ZTA"}

{"text": "I'm not much of a golfer myself,  but went along with friends and family for a fun afternoon. The building is elegant and the golf setup was really cool. Food was goodish (made up word) and beer selection was excellent.  However, I'm giving 2 stars for the horrific customer service.  That bad. This is my first ever Yelp review of any sort. I literally signed up for Yelp just to write this. Here's what happened. I was a waiter when i was in school and know the restaurant biz. The place was packed and I immediately recognized grossly understaffed. I tried to order a drink at the bar and got a \"one sec hun\" from the bartender lol. I stood there for 5 or so minutes and gave up. My group took an 8 top and we waited for 5 or 10 minutes, but a server never appeared. My brother drew the short straw and went up to the bar and right to a manager (name tag said hospitality manager or something like it). He looked at my brother like he just walked into his house and asked him to make him an omelet. It was hilarious. You could see the panic and sense of urgency in his eyes. My brother came back to our table with this poor, frantic, rushing hospitality leader and he took our drink order. 10 minutes later we were drinking very good beer and in 5 min we needed more. No server ever came to our table. We had to make another trip to the bar - dammit.  Got Mr inhospitable again and 10 minutes later we had our drinks. Wanting food we made the mistake of trying to coordinate a request.  Had two separate servers take our order. We think the first didn't have the photographic memory we assumed they had because ink and paper wasn't involved. Food took 30 min which isnt terrible when it's that busy, but it wasn't hot. Nachos stand out if they're getting cold. That goes back to short staffing and not having proper expo. We then golfed and that was a lot of fun. We had a sever out there and he took forever with drinks and was unfriendly and unhappy. We were there for about 3 hours and I think I had 4 beers. I would have liked to buy more. I cant be the only one complaining about Top Golf's cust service woes and I'm sure with the amount of money they're making they'll get there act together at some point, but I won't go through that circus again anytime soon. The company needs to hire just a couple more bartenders and a half dozen servers and train them, properly. Currently they have an awful front of the house management team and wait staff.", "review_id": "DNotj3oYfzgHgO1uC_coKQ"}
{"text": "Initial thoughts upon sitting down with a beer and hitting my first 15 shots: holy cow, I want to build one of these for myself! \n\nGetting to the nitty gritty of the review and thinking of the questions people would ask before visiting my review becomes a bit more specific. \n\n#1 * The wait staff was hired yesterday. Or at least that is the view I had when asking a few very simple questions about the system used here. They seemed to have zero training on the system used and how to operate simple functions. \n\n#2 * Our waitress was very eager to learn from us what we found out through trying it out. \n\n#3 * Computer systems down. There were more error screens than you could imagine here. One of the staff even said the app has never worked here. That's pathetic. Get someone on it. \n\nMy review is sounding awfully negative (but it needed to be said, otherwise no one would know what can be improved upon), which doesn't at all reflect my experience here so the rest will be how much fun I had. \n\n* Our waitress Michelle was amazing. It looks like she only had two tables, so you can't beat a ratio of 1:9. She was constantly making sure we were happy with what was on our table. \n\n* The music varies a ton! A good thing! I enjoyed listening to the cult classics and party music. \n\n* OMG The food! The food was top quality. Worth twice what it costs. No joke. \n\n\n\nIt is blatantly obvious I'm a bullet/list reviewer so here are my key points. \n*Technology- 6/10 train staff and hire an IT person. \n* Staff- 10/10 Some of the most friendly and eager staff I've seen around. Keep it up. \n* Food- 10/10 Id come here just to eat. Period. \n* Overall experience- 9/10 This place was a blast. I plan on visiting as often as I can when in the area.

I was steered here by a friend, and so I brought my two boys on a day that I wanted to get them off of their video game playing behinds.\n\nWe rented a stall for 2 hours (because I wanted them out, and there was some withdrawal symptoms from the video games). Started in the morning, so it was only $25/hr. We had a stall right away, didn't have to wait, but as I understand it there is a long wait on the weekends.\n\nThe golfing was a lot of fun, and I prefer it to bowling, honestly. Once I got my groove back, I was hitting 200 yard balls. I really need to get my own clubs though.\n\nWe had Mushi, which was a mexican twist on sushi, and a queso appetizer dish. Both were excellent! I was really surprised by the quality of the food. It was fancy restaurant good, honestly, and not overpriced. The boys had sodas, which they kept frequently filled.

{"text": "I was super stinkin excited that the sleepy East Valley got this in their hood. This is more family-oriented and relaxing than the Scottsdale one. If you haven't picked up golf as your game, you seriously are missing out. You certainly still get your share of entertainment from people watching. Ladies, where else would you have an open access to men literally having their tush pivoted to you most of the time? \n\nThe staff here is incredible. Our server was friendly and attentive despite having to cater to the needs of little ones and adults between two bays. Backup servers and bussers always made sure our table was clear and tidied up. Food is more your upscale bar gamut. The Bloody Mary is uhmazing! But if you are going to offer a bar of the condiments, make sure it is stocked. Running out of celery, bacon or olives for a Bloody Mary is total buzzkill. Was disappointed in the sangria as it tasted watered down. Love love love the wings, flatbreads and tacos. The highlight was the donut holes with the filling shots of raspberry, cream and chocolate. \n\nThe setup is very similar to the Scottsdale location; though, most of the seating is high chairs rather than the abundant lounging loveseats. Our bay was on the second floor and perfectly situated in the middle, close to the bar and all the TV screens. No worries gentlemen, each bay is equipped with a flat screen any how. Parking is huge and found it relatively easy to grab a spot. However, this location definitely lacks in efficiency when you are getting your player's card and reserving a bay. Half my group went online but still stood in a long line, despite we hadn't hit their peak hours.

{"text": "I enjoy the concept. The building is sleek and pleasing to look at in nightime as well as daytime. (I drive by this location sometimes 4 times a day, as it is 5seconds from the ice rink, which i go to 6days a week.)\n HOWEVER, the parking lot?! seriously? My Frys grocery store has a bigger parking lot. It took me almost 10 minutes to find a spot. (for so many bays, which can have 6 people golfing on one, youd think they would have planned accordingly to HIGH number of vehicles) it was 4:45 on a saturday, i knew it would be crowded, however the parking lot looks bigger from the street. I ended up having to make my own spot behind another vehicle alongside a curb. (when i left around 7:45 i came to find two vehicles parked in the middle of myself and the car on the other side, they totally blocked a thru zone btw parking lot curbs. ) i saw valet, however i did not know how much it costs, and did not have cash on me.\n\nThe inside is very nice. very modern. but it was a bit of a zoo. i didnt also enjoy having to wait very long time to get bays. since theres no call-ahead reservations, at least thats what the rest of my party told me upon entering. i thought there was supposed to be a person available to teach you how to swing, or rumor was that. Im not asking for golf lessons, but if there was someone available to come and educate your party before starting would be top notch!. The server at our bay was very attentive and pleasant. \nThey let us take the bay next to us that opened (since about 15 people ended up showing up and bays only hold comfortably about 8), which was very nice seeing as the location was busy!! the couches they have there were comfortable. One complaint was the heaters, you can turn off the ones by the tee but not behind by the couches, we were getting uncomfortably hot. I am eager to see how it goes for when its 115 degrees outside, better have strong AC!\n\nHowever, a very fun atmosphere. I hope to come again, but honestly, that parking issue might just keep me away! Maybe go in the early afternoon/late morning. However, for the price of it, i should just come back after i learn how to actually swing a golf club again, since i stopped golfing when i was 10.", "review_id": "ea1KeBOywnmgKEPsDu2n6A"}

I ordered the fried fish plate with cabbage and mashed potatoes and gravy for a total of $10.60 including tax.  \n\nFor starters they only gave me one small piece of what looked like fried tilapia from the frozen section of Walmart.   It was TINY.  For 10 dollars they could at least put two or three pieces of fish in the plate.  I think Shomars nearby has better fish than this and they give you a lot of fish for less.\n\nNow the cabbage was okay but the mashed potatoes were horrible.  They tasted like over-salted boxed mashed potatoes that were old and sitting up all day.  \n\nOverall the food was below expectations and not good at all.  Especially for the price.

Their menu also includes an assortment of appetizers, salads, curries, soups, rices/noodles, grilled items, healthy options and chef recommendations.\n\nThe service was great. Our waters were kept filled, everyone was really friendly and welcoming and they explained to us that they've been having issues with the licensing and other new business paperwork problems since December is a big holiday season and it's been hard with many offices closed and whatnot. But they informed us that as far as they know they'll be open for good now :)\n\nNow for the good stuff! The nums! Me and the boyfriend decided to go with their lunch specials which includes soup, mixed salad and your choice of white or brown rice.\n\nBBQ chicken: This is what my boyfriend ordered. Super flavorful, maybe a little too potent of a flavor for some if that makes sense lol has a rich sauce and you can definitely taste a grill flavor. 3.5/5 for me, 4/5 for Mr.Kitty.\n\nRed Curry: I went with the shrimp version and it was perfect. A good amount of shrimp, good consistency of the sauce, not spicy which I usually prefer but the flavor was definitely not lacking. The only thing, there was an extreme amount of bamboo shoots. I personally don't care for bamboo shoots but if you like them, it would be heaven for you lol. 4/5.\n\nLunch special soup: flavorful clear broth and I loved that they added two pieces of shu mai which were soft and fluffy. A really nice touch for complimentary soup.\n\nThe atmosphere is still cozy with a modern twist like how it was when it was called Taiga. Overall, a different twist on many thai favorites at a very reasonable price. We'll definitely be regulars!

You get 8 of them which is very generous considering many places have moved to only cream cheese rangoons and no crab (even if it is imitation).

Absolutely delicious though.\n3. Chicken Satay- Pretty good, a little small on the portion of chicken, but the peanut sauce was very delicious. (we actually went back for some today for our own peanut chicken skewers we made here at home)\n4. Ginger Chicken - This was fantastic. Tons of veggies and a good amount of chicken.

The flavor was excellent as well as the consistency; not too runny, not to thick. This came with your choice of white or brown rice. \n\n-Second, I ordered the pad thai. Once again this was on a scale from not spicy-spicy. I got a medium but the flavor was not spicy at all. Anyways, the noodle were very flavorful and all around good.

The second try was epically disappointing. The Moroccan mac and cheese with chicken. With a detox juice, because I'm mad about beets! Now, let me just put this out there: I make a wicked good mac and cheese. And it's probably a full 2,000 calories per serving. So, I'm particular about this dish. Let me also say that I don't like white meat. The marriage of this pasta with chicken breast just wasn't for me. At all. Dry meat and the spices were more on the sweet side.

I have been all around that place and never saw it. Very cool layout inside with high ceilings and urban decor. I didn't get to try the food, but I can't say enough at how friendly and helpful the staff was!\n\nWhat a great way to get into the Christmas spirit than seeing sweaters that remind me of the days when I was a kid with my Aunt and Uncle showing up to Christmas dinner in sweaters that competed with the tree! Amazing how many blind designers are making holiday sweaters. Hahahaha great showing. We should have done a group photo! \n\nLindsey, another outstanding event!!!

{"text": "Wear a sweater that's more embarrassing than my dye-job and my behavior?  Okay, count me in!\n\nIt was another fun night with Yelp Phoenix!  We showed up later than anticipated but we still had two hours of mingling, sipping hot mulled wine, and nibbling on what looked like a delicious spread [no time to eat when there was people to jabber with!].  Entrance was pet food and/or a pet gift that was donated to the Arizona Animal Welfare League.  Yelp Phoenix knows how to keep it classy by giving from their hearts.  50+ people were in attendance and we were allowed to bring a +1 so we got to sneak in our non-Elite friends to show them how we party!  There was a cookie decorating station, an ornament deco station, the *real* Santa, a hot chocolate bar, a White Elephant gift exchange, and a chance to go ice skating outside.  The venue itself is urban chic and lovely.  The servers were generous and were a delight to strike a conversation with.  My voice is absolutely coarse from all the laughter and chatter and I'll drink my hot tea tomorrow while thinking back to this amazing night fondly.\n\nI'm a bit confused though.  It says we were suppose to be at an Ugly Sweater party but I was clearly at a GORGEOUS sweater party!  Between Brett B.'s eye-gouging snowmen and Susan P.'s twinkly green light bulb earrings, Tom D.'s vomiting Rudolph with a Solo cup on the antler and Linh L.'s jingling Christmas poncho, Melodie C.'s starry vest and Meghan L.'s short-sleeved sweater, I thought I was at a fashion show in Milan!  Where did you all get such stylish sweaters?  Don't get me started on Cheryl B.'s adorable Grinchiness, Kurdy S.'s stripper Barbie sweater, and Kazi H's overflowing cuteness.  ;)  Although I'm not sure if I'd get my bum pinched by Melodie if I were in Milan --- that cheeky ginger!  Also, \"I'm Anime Melodie.\"\n\nThanks a million to Yelp, Lindsey and her cute baby belly, Santa [I swear I'm on the Nice List... maybe], DJ Sterling for a night of festive tunes, the folks at The Corner for hosting us wackos, and CityScape for tickets to ice skate!  \n\nHappy holidays, everyone!

Ugly sweaters as far as the eye can see. My favorite part of these events are always meeting people. It's great to make new friends and greet the old. Too long has it been since I've seen some of them and I get excited to share in stories, food, and drinks!\n\nYou know I'll be back for some downtown, outdoor, ice skating with that certificate everyone received.

I tried some of all the food (btw thanks to the Corner for refilling the food like 20 times for us!), I decorated and ate 3 cookies, and also made an ornament for my dog.  I didn't imbibe any alcohol, but the green apple seltzer water was amazing!

I wonder how I have not made it to The Corner considering I work downtown!!  The restaurant had a great vibe.  The manager was fabulous; she was cracking me up as I was going all-out decorating cookies.  I was an epic failure at the whole ugly sweater concept because I came straight from work.  Liz S and her husband looked awesome in their hideous green pug Christmas sweaters.  \n\nI brought some dog toys and treats for donation, I always love the events that raise items/funds for a good cause.  Lindsey always puts on great community event as always.  Speaking of Lindsey, she brought a +1 in her belly!  I am so excited for her!  \n\nOn to the important things like food!  The pizza was great I was a big fan of the margarita pizza, but the BLT pizza was amazing!  I like their cheese crusted crust!  The hummus and pita tided me over until I discovered the pizza, and the meat and cheese boards were decked out with great options.  I think I was drinking a stonecreek/wall (sorry can't remember the name), white wine blend that was pretty tasty to slug it all down.  The cranberry mimosas were a bit sweet for my liking, but they were surely the prettiest drinks.   \n\nOhhhh I am going to miss my fabulous Yelp community!  I brought a friend who is not a Yelper and now her New Years Resolution is to become Yelp Elite in 2015, so our community must be doing something right!

He really made me consider if I had been naughty or nice this year. I'm glad he saw the angel halo above my head because I was good this year!\n\nNow, about The Corner - this place is so cute. It's tucked away in downtown Phoenix Cityscape right next to the ice skating rink, we even got coupons to go skating. We tried a sampling of gourmet salads, cheese and charcuterie, homemade hummus muddled wine, cranberry mojitos, and topped it off with a cookie decorating station. Super fun! \n\nThat's not even the best part. We had the most epic exchange of white elephant gifts that I've ever seen. There were over 50 participants with an incredible range of gift ideas. Have you ever received a shake weight? You probably want to. It was a big hit as a white elephant gift. If you're tired of looking at your old bowling trophy- why not gift it to the white elephant gift exchange? Somebody did!

While standing in line to check in there was a mom with a little girl about 4 who spotted Santa and she wanted to see him but was scared, but that Santa, he knows how to win them over and he made her smile real quick, it just tickled me pink on the inside, because that right there was the spirit of Christmas, that's right I do believe in good ole Saint Nick, just as I get older, it's hard to behave all year along.\n\nThis Elite event was set up to take donations for Arizona Animal Welfare League, and boy did we show up with some great treats & food for our 4 legged friends!\n\nOk by now most have been around to know the music that was playing was done by no other than DJ Sterling, I am a huge fan of this man, DJ Sterling always has his music on point, there has never been a party he is at that didn't have people singing or on their feet dancing! \n\nThe Corner, wow this place is amazing, it's huge and roomy, there were well over 50+ elites and friends but it didn't seem over bearing. The food was amazing, there was hummus, salads, fresh pita bread, meats & cheese platters, flatbreads topped with hummus and grilled veggies, but what stole the show for me was the BLT pizza, OMG it was to die for! Pizza with Bacon will always win with me, yummy!

{"text": "My favorite phrase of the evening came from the Corner Bakery manager herself when I glanced at the sugar cookies and quizzily asked her, \"are these baked fresh?  They look homemade.\"  And her everlasting, imprinted on my brain response was, \"Yes!  If this place could squeeze their own olive oil from fresh olives, they would!  I was shocked how small the walk in fridge/freezer is when I started working here- they really do make everything from scratch!\"  \n\nAfter hearing those phrases, I was a bit star struck since as an architect myself having done some tenant improvements for restaurants and being familiar with the operating side of a restaurant, I know sometimes \"homemade\" means premade dough ordered from a vendor and baked on premise. \n\nApparently, not this place!!!\n\nThis place is the REAL deal!!!  A gem, a definite gem!\n\nAnd to think how often I've been to Cityscape and bypassed this place thinking it was just another \"chain bakery that should not be named.\"  \n\nSo, so happy to know how erroneous I've been. So much so that I shall spent the majority of this review pontificating the FRESHNESS of the menu items at this place!!!!  And yes, I shall be back again and again for the FRESH cookies!, FRESH salads!, FRESH pizza- oh the BLT pizza mentioned in so many of the other reviews, yes, yes, it was also my favorite!!!  Did you know bacon is paleo so I ate without remorse!  And glad my husband was vegetarian cause that meant more for me!!!\n\nAlthough, even the vegetarians did not go hungry- there were 3 kinds of salads, cheese, and 2 types of vegetarian (one w grilled veggies, the other simple fresh tomato slice w pesto).\n\nThere was definitely food a plenty- a meat and cheese board, 3 different types of salads, 3 different types of pizza, cookies, hot chocolate w fixings of whipped cream, chopped candy cane, beer, wine, sparkly drinks, mimosa, mulled wine- it was dazzling!!! \n\nAnd there was more!  A Santa, a DJ playing, ornament decorating and the 50+ person which was the largest I've participated in yet it flowed smoothly cause The Yelpers in the room were such cool cats!  My favorite white elephant gift was an actual bowling trophy with engraved name & all. It was such a Seinfield gift. Totally hilarious and the moment of confusion when the white elephant was unwrapped was priceless. \n\nOh, and the ugly sweaters- some got really creative- see my pics!!!\n\nLindsey!

The hot chocolate was so good and what was inside those aerosol whipped cream canisters? I've never had whipped cream that yummy before- at least not in a can. The food itself flew out like well hotcakes, with charcuterie, flatbreads and salads it was all lovely. There were yummy alcoholic beverages like the mulled wine and cranberry spritzer type cocktail as well as old fashioned styled sodas.

As for me, the spiced pear pancakes and also, a side order of that wonderful bacon - slow cooked so that it is still soft but also crispy, yum!\n\nA big shout out to the staff there that was super friendly (sort of like going to Disneyland, everyone is greeting you) and especially to Vinny, or exceptional server who was nice enough, at the end of the meal, to ask if I wanted a to-go cup of coffee - never been asked that at any other breakfast place in the area so like I said, exceptional service.\n\nAll I can say is, whoever owns and manages Snooze knows how to run a business.

They serve pancakes, french toast, a bevy of omelets and yes, if you want to get your drink on first thing in the AM they've got you covered there too with a random assortment of drinks to choose from.\n\nBest of all, if you're gluten-free, there are options for you too. Snooze gluten-free pancakes and french toast are some of the best I've had anywhere and it makes you almost forget what you're missing.\n\nAlmost.\n\nSo yes, the secret is out. Snooze is one of the country's best brunch places and now that you'll figure this out, I imagine I'll have to wait in line.

{"text": "Very excited that Tempe has this new breakfast spot close to my office at ASU. I've been here three times, twice on my own cause that's how I roll. As a single diner, I like the fact they've got counter spaces where I can chill out and not feel I'm taking up precious table real estate. \n\nThe food has been great each time, but it's in the area of service that they need to up their game a bit. I happened to be in today when their computers were down, which led to much confusion on the part of bartenders, who now needed to figure out how to run a manual credit card purchase (the nostalgia of running a credit card to get an imprint). Kids these days don't know anything about manual -- so there were five 20somethings scratching their heads. Kind of hilarious if you ask me.\n\nSo, after a long wait for my bill to be rung up, the bartender comes over to explain what this \"oldfangled\" manual credit receipt was all about. Unfortunately, she didn't know she wasn't meant to write out the full total on the receipt, that I was supposed to do that so I could include a tip on the card.  Since she'd totaled it and I couldn't put a tip on the card, she seemed a bit miffed that I pointed her error out to her, and came to the realization she'd errored her way out of tip.\n\nSo, I then had to wait another 15 minutes to get a 50$ bill changed, so that I could leave a tip, and not appear like some schmuck.  If she'd told me at the outset their computers were down, I would have just paid cash at the get go.\n\nOh, and when you sit at the smaller side counter next to the bar, I think it would be great not to have people standing behind me crowding me out and hovering like vultures sipping on bloody marys waiting for me to finish my breakfast so they could snatch the spot, because obviously they are more valuable for the space than me.", "review_id": "M0x2Q7eogztk6r40jHlLaw"}

There are a few other choices for sandwiches at this intersection, but having tried the other places, I can safely declare this the best option. \n\nWhile I was waiting for my food, a guy came in and said he's been to sandwich places all over the East coast (and listed some States known for solid sandwich shops) and that this was the best sandwich he's ever had. I mean, if I was a real professional culinary critic, I would have been suspicious that they paid him to come in and say all that stuff. But I'm not and it was legit.

I would have enjoyed a miso soup too- but maybe they'll add that to the menu later. \n\nI can't remember exactly what I ordered but it was delicious.

My boyfriend ordered the majority of the salmon based dishes and was very satisfied with the quality of the fish as well.\n\nMy only complaint was that service was rather slow- we received the first round of sushi relatively quickly (about 20 minutes after ordering), but after that there was a long wait between each order and it took almost 2 hours to be served our complete order. The restaurant only opened a week ago, so I think the staff is still figuring out the logistics.

And the back story I read on this years display was 1 week before the start of the Christmas light show, Marc discovered all the programming for his light show was stolen. How disheartening. All that hard work gone. Amazing that he got it put out on time! There was 24 songs listed on the playlist.\n \nIt's pretty cool how the lights fit the theme of the music. Like in \"Let it Go\" from Frozen, the light show colors twinkle blue! It's just brilliant how each song is different set of light patterns and colors.\n \nHow did they manage to put lights on the palm trees?  A crane of course.\n \nHow do you get here. Easy. From Eastern turn onto Robindale heading west(towards LVBLVD) After you past Spencer, you'll see the home on your right side. Parking available in front of home.

{"text": "Tonight's show was the first public preview show.  The premiere will be this weekend.  The show consists of 19 songs--showstoppers from Broadway musicals--that were evidently chosen by Steve Wynn.  There are 19 songs in all as of this evening.\n\nThe show opens with a medley of songs from Hello Dolly and Mame, then Cabaret and finally Chicago.  In between there are some shows that are represented by one song including one called \"Ol' Las Vegas\" a takeoff on the song \"No Name City\" from Paint Your Wagon.\n\nThe cast consists of 66 people counting a full orchestra and a large complement of singers and dancers with several lead singers.  The cast is extraordinarily talented.  They sing beautifully and the dancing is done very well.\n\nMy favorite numbers for the evening were \"Willkomen\" from Cabaret, \"Cell Block Tango\" from Chicago, \"Everything's Coming Up Roses\" from Gypsy, and the \"Chorus Line/One\" opening number for A Chorus Line.  The solo numbers were absolute standouts including \"All That Jazz\" from Chicago.\n\nA few thoughts on the show.  Note, I am a theatre junkie.  I love all types of theatre, especially Broadway.  While I enjoyed this show a whole lot, it's too short at just about 1 hour and 5 minutes.  I couldn't believe they were doing curtain calls so quickly.  The show started about 5 minutes late--what do they think this is, the Smith Center?  Perhaps the late start was opening night.  Early on, one of the characters introduces a number with some short comments.  After that, a recorded Steve Wynn introduced some sections and individual numbers.  Do we really need a recorded Steve Wynn telling us what \"Razzle Dazzle\" from Chicago is about?  All I could think was, \"Pot, meet kettle.\n\nOn the way out, we were handed a survey to help them improve the show.  The last question is \"Would you recommend this show to family, friends, and Las Vegas visitors?\"  The possible answers given are:  1) Yes - it's a great show for all; 2) Maybe - depends on whether they like Broadway or not; and 3) No.  And there's the rub.  The show will be liked mostly by people who know and like Broadway.  The show will appeal to the older demographic, certainly not the Tryst nightclub goer.\n\nI hope the show succeeds but I wonder if it can.  Very talented singers and dancers weren't enough to keep Spamalot and Avenue Q in this theatre and there are no bells and whistles like Phantom.  Time will tell.\n\nAs a tip, the website did not allow choosing a seat rather you are assigned one.  I'd recommend sitting at least four to five rows from the stage.

{"text": "The best mediocrity money can buy--that's the only way I can describe Showstoppers.  This is definitely an ego piece for Steve Wynn, producing a show for his own exclusive pleasure without any regard for Vegas demographics or the taste of Vegas show-goer's.  I am not a Broadway neophyte, yet I found the choice of material puzzling, if not obscure.  The talent is at a high technical level, but the cast lacks charisma, and the show lacks charm and humor.  The show would have been considered old and dated 25 years ago, and consists very much the sort of material I have seen in high school Broadway reviews.  Showstoppers would be very much at home on a cruise ship, but it is an anachronism on a Vegas stage.  Given what Le Reve has to offer next door, the ticket prices (close to Le Reve's) are scandalous.  The show will appeal to the 60-plus crowd, which is exactly the Vegas visitor demographic that has been dwindling in numbers over the past few years, so it will have difficulty finding an audience--I couldn't imagine recommending it to anyone, other than a Broadway buff in their 70's (and I only know one person who fits that description).  Steve Wynn has proven that he knows a lot of things, but with Showstoppers, he has proven that he is completely out of touch with contemporary entertainment tastes.  Given the demographic to which it will appeal, the show stands a chance of success if they cut the ticket price in half (with a further 50% discount if you show your AARP card), have a showtime of 5 pm and throw in the buffet for free.  It's a shame that in a town where a really new and exciting show would be welcomed with open arms, the man who can have any show he wants decides he wants a dusty old Broadway review.", "review_id": "oYvIfTV5yWVd4xAyhDqr5A"}
{"text": "I wanted to like this show so badly. The concept was genius: Vegas doesn't want to sit through a 3 hour Broadway musical, so let's just take the best of the hits and put it in an hour and a half show...\n\nFirst of all. It lasted an hour and ten minutes if that. Second, I love broadway. But these shows are so outdated. And of the outdated-ness there are so many classics missing. They performed these blocks of certain musicals like Cabaret and Chicago instead of moving on to other shows. \n\nThey could have really put a decent storyline to this. But they didn't. Instead, they had a few narrators that made you feel really disconnected. Some of the narration was by Steve Wynn that made me feel like I was listening to the discovery channel. \n\nPretty much every song was your the epitome of a Broadway jazzy show tune. I would have loved to see them slow it down a few times without the cheesy smiles and sequins. Don't Cry for Me Argentina, Memory, I Dreamed a Dream, Music of the Night, Defying Gravity.. These are all ShowStoppers..no? \n\nThere were a few moments I was really excited for a song and overall the show was done very well. But when you aren't familiar with a certain musical and they do three songs from it, you get sort of antsy. I hope that they can fine tune this show with audience feedback because I want it to survive.", "review_id": "76euKwvE9YVy647jZmaFaw"}
{"text": "While I do agree with most of the negative comments and the reasons given for them by the first three reviewers, both my wife and I found Showstoppers, while clearly flawed in some respects, to be very entertaining, energetic, happy presentation, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is fond of musical theatre.  We left \"singing and dancing,\" so to speak, and isn't that what how you want to feel when you leave a Broadway musical?\nThat said, the show could clearly benefit from some serious \"tweaking,\" and my criticisms largely echo those of the other reviewers.\nIt clearly is too short.  My wife and I both predicted that the closing number would be from A Chorus Line, which it basically was, ignoring \"There's No Business Like Show Business.\"  Yet, when it ended and the cast took their perfunctory bows, I found it difficult to accept that this was \"all that there is,\" and they weren't going to come out again for one more \"wow\" number.  We left kind of scratching our heads.\nThe show needs a good emcee.  Steve--shut your mouth, get out of the way, and get someone who can move the show from one song to the next smoothly.  YOU ARE NOT THE SHOW.  WE DON'T SHARE YOUR INTEREST IN YOURSELF.\nEveryone has their own favorite numbers, but some of the selections, given other possibilities, seemed strange.  Could have done without the number from Damn Yankees as well as the opening number, which was too obscure for me.\nAgree that during the \"have to set up the stage for the next big number\" it would have been terrific to have he show slow down a bit with perhaps someone performing \"Memories\" from Cats, or some other Andrew Lloyd Weber song--there are so many of them, and this would get the audience relaxed and ready for the next razzle-dazzle  number. \nThe cast was terrific, in my opinion.  They have talent, have clearly worked so very hard, and it shows.  They deserve to have Steve step back and let someone more experienced in musical theatre take over.  Why not include the big number from Mame?  Not sure what is required to get authorization to do any particular number, etc., but there is no doubt, in my mind, that some substitutions would make for a much better show.\nI hope Showstoppers makes it.  I'd go to see it again if it were tweaked.  Hell--you could change the show every couple of months if you had enough numbers prepared, etc.  Wouldn't that be something?", "review_id": "zKVLU6wnxKNCOvatMn9ymw"}

They have many talented performers singing and dancing.  What I liked most was the full orchestra behind the dancers on stage.

{"text": "My gf and I went to the Christmas Eve show and really enjoyed ourselves. I understand the criticism of not having a few more contemporary numbers within the show (something from Phantom, Wicked, or Les Mis, etc), but it did not detract us at all from having a terrific experience. The full orchestra and ensemble had so much energy and talent. The music was great, a great majority of the songs were familiar (and we only have a mild Broadway knowledge), and the dancing and choreography were well done. The cast has clearly put a lot of time and effort into the production. \nI've seen a few reviews that are critical of Mr Wynn's voice being heard. Three things: 1. He only speaks three times that I can remember. 2. He only says three or four sentences when he does speak. 3. The show is called Steve Wynn's Showstoppers. \nThey will surely add to the show and make tweaks as they go to make improvements.

The guy built an amazingly beautiful set of casinos which feature some of the best restaurants I've ever eaten in. A completely over the top show featuring several of the most popular songs from some of the most famous musicals seems totally at home here to me.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed almost every aspect of this dazzling show. The talented cast had me stunned from start to finish. The vocal talent is absolutely amazing especially the lead female vocalist. At one point I found my mouth gaping open I was so taken by her. \n\nThe dancing is top notch and the dancers were breathtakingly beautiful.  \n\nEvery costume seemed impeccably designed. My guess would be that, like every thing else at Wynn, no expense was spared. To me delight, there were several costume changes throughout the show and none of them disappointed. \n\nThe show is very short at just over an hour. I loved the selection of music, all upbeat fun and often funny dance numbers.  In a case like this, where there is so much material to pull from, I wish they had added a few more numbers. I worry that some audience members may feel cheated by the length. \n\nFinally, the only thing I did not like about the show were the parts with Mr. Wynn's voice overs. I actually HATED these. They seemed out of place, clumsy, and borderline creepy. I heard they are still tweaking the show, and I sincerely hope these are the first to go. \n\nOther than the voiceovers, this show is a must see and highly highly recommend!", "review_id": "lCfdp0ks5w2HAaIDnTPVpQ"}
{"text": "What a great tribute to the classic American Musical Theater!  Incredible talent, amazing orchestra (and full orchestra at that - no half pre-recorded or sequenced keyboards).  The set is pretty amazing as well. \n\nMy only (minor) beef was it was too short.  Only 70 minutes?  Needs a couple more numbers to at least make it 80.  I also agree with another Yelper who mentioned Steve's voice over in the show.  I would have rather had one of the 4 main performers come out and share that information.  I know it's covering costume changes and all that, but you've spent all the money on a great live orchestra - have them play a little ditty or something to fill time. Musicians love to ham it up (well, strings usually don't, but brass players do).  \n\nSince the show's only been running for 2 weeks when I saw it, I'm sure they are still tweaking the flow a little bit.

{"text": "First, kudos to the cast and orchestra - they all did a terrific job.  That is the good.  The \"not so good\" would be, as others have suggested, that the show is all of an hour and 5 minutes long.  Just about when you would expect intermission, the show is over.  We are old enough (late 50's) that we were familiar with all of the songs, so we enjoyed them.  For those whose memory is fading, or younger people who may not be familiar with all of the shows the songs came from, it might be nice if cast members would spend a bit of time giving some history of the shows the songs are coming from (that could lengthen the show as well, and give us a sense that we were getting better value from the $140 or so per ticket).  A vaguely troubling issue to us was the fact that there seemed to be no thought, when putting the show together, to trying to weave some sort of theme that would tie the show together.  It was just a number of songs that, while superbly performed, were just that.  The show lacks a bit on the entertainment value. \n\nWe met one of the staffers for the show on our way out, and she asked us for an opinion, which we gave.  The background we got, whether accurate or not, was interesting.  She suggested that the voiceovers from Steve Wynn were sort of a requirement as she told us that the term \"Showstoppers\" was copyrighted, and thus they had to go to some length to avoid a lawsuit, and this was why Steve Wynn was doing the voiceovers.  (Seems like a more elegant solution might be to name the show something else, like A Vegas Tribute to Broadway or something).  We suggested that while the songs were great, that it seemed like some of the great songs from Broadway musicals were missing.  The response was that Steve Wynn had difficulty obtaining the rights to songs.  Perhaps this is why we didn't hear some of the great songs from shows like West Side Story, The Music Man, Evita, and others.  Too bad.\n\nThe bottom line for us was that we enjoyed it, but the show just seemed to be lacking something (length, songs, and a theme).  In comparison to a show like Jersey Boys, which we would go back to multiple times, Showstoppers doesn't seem to have that appeal.  \n\nSo, Mr. Wynn, a pretty good effort, but it really needs something more.", "review_id": "-1UDNYG7wqSQVfR845oWcw"}

I guess that's what so great about the holiday since \"holiday attire\" can mean so many things to different people.  Bruce K. deserved the win (risking electrocution all for the sake of Yelp).  Nice to meet a lot of new faces too.\n\nNikki - Amazing event (as always) and you didn't burn the chocolate!  Thanks for the shout out about my closing (so relieved!).\n\nTonya - thank you for documenting!  I love the fact that you took so many pictures that your battery died.  Love me some PopRock Photography - in fact I was thinking about trying to make up an event just so I can hire you.\n\nDan C. - sorry about all the BooBirds...  We only booed you because we don't want you to move away!  You will definitely be missed.\n\nA great way to end 2014 and it just makes me look forward to all the fun that is in store for 2015.", "review_id": "o3d8LhLBnRBlG0SaYX0g2g"}

{"text": "How do you end a great Yelp year for the Yelp Elites?  Well, you throw a fun party and invite all the gang.  This past Tuesday is exactly how Nikki W ended the 2014-year in Yelp (CLT Elite Edition).\n\nWas it fun...heck yes!  IOS Greek Kitchen provided the perfect intimate setting to throw this shindig.  \n\nAtmosphere - Lighting, intimately dim.  Noise, with a lively concrete floor and other hard surfaces abound the decibels were noticeable.  Fun factor, definitely set to high, as everyone seemed to be having a good time and were engaging.  Festivus factor, the venue was appropriately decorated...now the sweaters...that's another story (I think Bruce K. and Jeff S. will be receiving energy efficiency guides from Duke Energy).\n\nService - Awesome!  The staff was friendly, attentive, and handled the large crowd with ease.  The drink servers were doing a great job keeping my glass filled.  I thought the bartenders were on their game too.  I even saw one bartender hand muddling some mint (to release its flavor), which is much better than just tossing it into a glass.\n\nFood - Well, the drinks were very tasty.  The American Mule is now my new favorite cocktail.  Who doesn't like vodka, lime, and ginger beer?  Communists, that's who!   The food is where I get lost.  Yes, there was food.  It looked and smelled delicious.  However, the line was long and I kept waiting for it to go down before jumping in.  When I realized that people were already looping the line for seconds (and maybe thirds) all that was left was pita and lettuce.  I guess that is what I get for being lazy.    \n \nOverall - I had a great time talking to old friends an making some new ones (Tara L and Ian H were kind enough to adopt me for the night).  I was even able to take another inception (scenario 2) photo of Tonya from Poprock Photography.  Merry Christmas to me!  \n\nA big thanks goes out to our CM, Nikki W, as for me it was definitely a complete night to another tremendously complete year with Yelp. \n\nI hope to see everyone again in 2015!!!", "review_id": "X5M-Lw10raz_RkKSv0lbFQ"}

{"text": "A very bittersweet event as 2014 comes to a close. So many good events over the year, and this was no exception. Of course you know a good event when you hear it named after the makeshift holiday from Seinfeld. \n\nSo who's got two thumbs and is a big fan of Greek food? This guy. I've been meaning to try out IOS for a little while now so I was excited to hear that they coordinated with Yelp for this.\n\nI arrived not knowing what to expect from the atmosphere and interior as I knew it was more of a small space, but it was very welcoming, and not \"fast food\"-like. It is well decorated and low-lighted. The staff working the event did an amazing job keeping drinks in our hands and our buffet filled. Our server seemed to be constantly on her toes.\n\nThe drinks and food were fantastic. I guess I assumed it would be a lot similar to a Showmars, but afterwards I left thinking that it would be a great place to stop by around seeing an SMG movie and have a real decent meal with some good quite atmosphere, comparably. \n\nThe beer special- NB white IPA- I could (and did) drink that all night long! So good! Although I didn't partake, I looked over at a few having the cocktail and that looked really good. There was wine available for us as well.\n\nThe food was definitely the highlight of the night- pita rounds, homemade hummus, veggies, grilled chicken, lamb, etc. It was all fantastic. Definitely got in line more than once! Nikki also had a great dessert table put together, and if I wasn't a scrooge when it comes to sweets I would've been all over that! Pretzels, marshmallows, chocolate, etc.\n\nThanks to all those at IOS, Nikki for another fantastic event, and HUGE thanks to her on a fantastic year of Yelp elite!

I bet he didn't mean hot mess, but that's what this review is gonna be... \n\nWhat a tremendous way to close out 2014.  First off, you knew this was going to be a killer event because: (a) we got a pretty adequate CM, I hear; (b) anything referencing Seinfeld is fine in my book (sick that it's 1 of 3 shows I watch?); (c) IOS is awesome; or (d) all of the above.  Hint:  #notabc\n\nIn true Festivus fashion, there were the Feats of Strength - no, I didn't wrestle anyone, but we saw Poprock Photography all over the place.  Sometimes you wonder how she captures one moment from multiple angles.  IOS staff was on top of its game, feeding the masses.  A good portion of food ran out right on me (typical), but didn't have to wait longer than a 30-second minute.   Hot, fresh Greek bites - really solid food.  There was a moment when the party went silent and all that remained was pita bread, Greek salad, and me.  Festivus faeries sang in the distance. You couldn't tear me away, but I'd occasionally snap back to reality to power up from my trusty mug'o'Mule #untilservertookmymug.  \n\nOf course, all the heavy-lifting was done on the one-and-a-half shoulders of our CM, Nikki.  Her Feats started from booking the venue to dropping off donations.  Quick aside... this past year, she taught us, among other things - how to design cookies (kinda, I still suck), how make my own pizza (again, kinda), how to eat crawfish (Chernobyl looked better than the aftermath of where I sat), and how to have fun (finally something I'm good at).  She does an amazing job.  \n\nSadly, this was the last event for 2014, and myself. #yelpdc #hereicome It was a great experience to be a part of a great community and meet some wonderful people. I hope to keep in touch with y'all and thanks for making Charlotte special even if you're really from Shelby.

{"text": "Did Yelp choose its Elites by how talented and versatile they are?! Such amazing buncha people! And Nikki did it again. Yes, she found the right place in the heart of the city for the perfect group of people. \n\nI knew this place existed in Epicentre but never been. Luckily Yelp had its Yelp Elite Holiday party at Ios so I got to check it out. First of all, the entrance was a bit hard to find for me. Maybe it was the decorations for the special event that distracted/confused me. In any case, I went to the side door closer to Mortimers. And Nikki was there to greet me. She came out of nowhere! That's how attentive and awesome she is.\n\nThe interior was very different from what I had imagined. Yes, I didn't check online beforehand. I was exepecting something a bit more like Showmars plus Wild Wings. Instead I found a casual dining area with a hip looking bar in the back (or side).\n\nServers were friendly and quick. At one point I turned around unintentionally to find one of them holding a tray and waiting for me to get out of her way with a smile. I thought she was nice. The drinks, yes, the drinks of life, were great. The Americam Mule was phenomenal. The Accumulation was another great drink. Never heard of it but I really liked the pale ale.\n\nAll in all it was a good place to hang out. Not sure if I'd recommend taking someone special out for a special night or plan a big party there though. Nice place to hangout. And the sweaters were super... merry.

{"text": "This event was at a great venue with a terrific layout that made socializing easy! I was so very appreciative to have been invited and was floored that the restaurant closed their doors for us. Thank you Nikki and thank you to IOS.\n\nI really loved their chopped salad with their \"green goddess\" dressing along with a slice of the pita bread. Mouth watering good! I was disappointed to see a few things - the setup was done in a way where they only we're able to put out a little at a time, and it was all in a few small trays on a side table, which meant a very long wait to get to taste their yummy food. The wait could have been greatly alleviated with a larger set up - maybe something to keep in mind for the next time IOS does a large event. I was also sad to see they frequently ran out of dishes - seemingly just as I was about to get to try them (as I was queued up in line.) Additionallu, they \"ran out\" of hummus. Which, was just odd - considering its a staple food in any Mediterranean restaurant. Then, we looked over and noticed they were making to-go orders and had a large tub of what appeared to be hummus.\n\nIn their defense, I suspect they allowed a certain amount of food for the event and that amount had been used up. They likely had reserves because they were going to work in the kitchen on to go orders. Still it was disappointing to not get to have any when my 40 min wait was up in line.\n\nNow, I was lucky enough to try a few bites of their main proteins - chicken and lamb for gyros. The chicken was good - clean white (not fatty or poorly trimmed) chicken breast. Now... The lamb, OH MY!!!! The lamb was juicy, moist, and incredibly well seasoned/marinated. It was great - I could really see myself going back for that along with the salad and green goddess dressing.\n\nThe general manager and sales manager also greeted our group and told us about IOS.\n\nHere's the scoop: \n\nIOS Is a new trendy Greek restaurant on the lower level of the epicenter. It just opened in May. It has a small footprint, but that still affords plenty of seating. They also have a nice full service bar. I cannot speak to their drinks, I went with diet soda during my visit. \n\nThey also offer takeout, delivery if you work or life nearby, ms if you're staying at the ALoft hotel, they bring you their dishes for room service. The epicenter has parking for at least $10, BUT (TIP!!!) if you go across the street it's half price parking.\n\nI thought the food was good - overall. I thought their chopped Greek salad with green goddess dressing, and their lamb was indeed memorable. For the event, I would have liked to see a different layout - one that reduced waiting time, a more consistent flow and volume of food for the number in our group, and was sad when they ran out of meat as well as hummus. \n\nWould I recommend IOS Greek kitchen, yes! I think it's a great new restaurant with a lot of potential. Constructively, I think the event could have been a little better supported by the kitchen. I think Nikki did a fantastic job at pulling everything together.", "review_id": "zldR6pxzx7Mu0uUpaZRF7g"}

I had to try it so I went for the managers special, a half sandwich (I chose an oven roasted trky panini) and a side salad bar (which is a nice size).  The panini I got (if you can call it like that) was a wrinkled white bread with a few pressed marks, trky, guacamole, pepper jack cheese and thousand island dressing and even like that it tasted bland with no wow whatsoever, my God, I think I have tasted better sandwiches at the PDQ. The salad was better, they have a nice variety of toppings like beets, green olives, feta cheese besides all the normal toppings you see at other restaurants. Also, at another station they have like mini muffins, nuts, seeds, croutons and crackers to complement your salad. They also have an ice cream machine where you serve yourself for FREE. \n\nMy hubby got the chicken Alfredo pasta with a side of garlic bread and he did not like it at all, pasta was overcooked and the meat and sauce he said tasted like they came from a frozen bag.

This was a goat based soup.\n\nA BIG generous dishes of slow braised fall off the bone tender, beef ribs, and lamb arrive, a dish of stewed potatoes followed by a plate of tender flavorful dark quarters of chicken on a platter with more couscous and an assortment of vegetables.\n\nWe also tried tasting style chicken bastilla.

I didn't have to wait to be seated (unlike the other place, which can take up to forever!).  My student was Cliff.  He gave the best shampoo, I swear, I would have him wash my hair everyday if I can.  Instructors are around, more so than the other place, but I still don't think is enough.  Final tap: $9!\n\nNow the not so good news.  As much as I think Cliff was fine, he did mess it up a little. The back was a little uneven and blunt (not blending well with the rest of my hair). I called, and luckily I had no problem going back 2 days later and getting it fixed, this time with the instructor standing next to him practically the whole time (I kinda insisted, considering I am running out of hair to be messed with).  Final result is fine... esp for $9.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Cheap good place to go if you have an easy trim/nothing too technical.  Don't be afraid to speak up, or ask for instructor, or go back if needed to get fixed.  From my observation, this is an ethnic hair friendly place (many students are blacks, and I know they have different hair styling technics).

{"text": "First Shake Shack on the West Coast! After having Shake Shack in New York, I couldn't contain my excitement when I heard one was opening up in Vegas. So of course we had to be one of the first people to christen it. We showed up 1.5 hours before the official grand opening and were literally first in line haha. Instead of having us stand to the side in the cold, one of the staffers actually came out to greet us and then offered us some seating on the patio under the heaters. Great service even before the doors opened! \n\nAs for the food, my go-to is the Shack Stack with red peppers - a cheeseburger topped with a deep fried cheese-stuffed portobello mushroom. Heaven on a bun! I also breathed a sigh of relief when I heard that the crinkle cut fries are here to stay instead of the natural cut fries. \n\nLet me be one first to welcome Shake Shack to the West Coast - hopefully the first of many!", "review_id": "q_bCGAxs5eIScTpqF7fqgQ"}
{"text": "Delicious burgers- a standout from the crowd of mediocre burger chains. Being from the Midwest these are a dime a dozen. The burger was flavorful and delicious and the bun was soft and fluffy; the best part, it didn't fall apart one bit or get soaked in grease. \n\nThe people working were super friendly despite being the opening day. I heard they opened one in Chicago and this was good enough to venture there sometime. Also much cheaper than the chi-chi burger places in the strip hotels. Worth a try if you're hungry and want to eat without venturing through the smoky murkiness of hotel casinos.  Yum!", "review_id": "d1T-t5wpyKXALaCJ6oVhUg"}

I contemplated letting my husband have a bite of my burger but I realized it would be one fewer bite for me so I kept eating. \n\nI was surprised that there weren't more people in line for the grand opening but I trust that people will flock here to the first West Coast location based on its stellar reputation. I will say that the friendly staff (both behind the registers & the ones in suits) on top of the delicious food have made us lifelong Shack Shack customers. \n\nAs a Californian, I do prefer Shake Shack to In N Out. I love how soft the bun is, the freshness of the lettuce and tomato, and something I can't put my finger on. This was the first time I finished my food before my husband & I was lamenting when the burger was gone.

I am from Los Angeles and just happened to be in Vegas the day Shake Shack had its grand opening. Of course we stopped by to get our grub on! To my surprise, it wasn't a long wait. We waited maybe only 15 minutes and they gave us samples of their vanilla and chocolate concretes which kept me even more happy and satisfied. \n\nThis is by far the largest Shake Shack I have ever been to. Lots of ample seating inside and outside. Heating lamps outside for those chilly winter nights. Decor is super modern and yet comfy. Service was great as usual and food was done super quick. This is a very friendly and efficient staff considering it was grand opening and there are sometimes hiccups. But I saw no hiccups. They were all a machine and happily working.\n\nMy fiance and I got the Stack Shack which is my personal favorite. I love the cheesy portabello mushroom with my burger. I also normally get their vanilla shake but this time we changed it up and got their special which was the salted caramel shake. I am so glad we did. This shake was phenomenal and so delicious and creamy! It wasn't too sweet. It was just perfection.\n\nJust as a heads up, Shake Shack is technically not connected to a specific hotel. It is located in between NYNY and Monte Carlo. You can't miss it!\n\nAhh even as I am writing this, I am craving their shakes. Their shakes are phenomenal.

{"text": "Shake Shack has opened in Las Vegas with a bang. I have been a huge fan for years, and since moving to Vegas from the East Coast I couldn't be happier to see it in Sin City. \n\nI went the first weekend it opened, and the line was VERY long for being 5 p.m. on a Sunday night. It was all hands on deck--tons of staff members were working in the kitchen and working the dining room floor.\n\nHere's how it works at Shake Shack: You get in line, place your order, get your buzzer and wait for your buzzer to ring. Try to get a spot at one of the tables while you wait. Then you pick up your tray at the counter.\n\nAll of their burgers are bomb--my favorite is the Smoke Shack with bacon and little bits of spicy pickled peppers. Vegetarians will be happy with their portabello burger, which is stuffed with cheese and then fried. So decadent. Their cheese fries are AMAZING--don't think about the calories, just indulge. They recently switched back to their crinkle cut fries, which aren't \"fresh-cut\" but have that nostalgia factor.\n\nI am a personal fan of Shake Shack's hot dogs--their Shack-cago dogs are freaking amazing.\n\nDuring this visit, one of the staff members saw that it was my friend's birthday and offered to bring her a frozen custard of her choice. When they brought it out a bunch of staff came out and surrounded our table, and then one worker started singing Happy Birthday.

{"text": "OK all, I do not enjoy being the lone  3 star rating in a sea of 5 star raters from truly burgerlicious yelping gurus.  I went to the NY NY Hotel today to try Shake Shack and overall, I am rating the food a solid 3 star!\n\nFirst of the location ambiance and feel of the place is 5 star. I like the location right on the strip, plenty of views to see all, and outdoor seating when it get's too busy!\n\nLocation - 5 Star - As above\n\nAmbiance - 5 Star - As above\n\nMenu and Choices - 5 Star - Check out their menu online or on the wall. It is great.\n\nService - 5 Star - You have a rather large menu on the wall or laminated menus to review your plethora of choices that can be amazing.  \n\nFood - 3 star - We opted for a simple hamburger with cheese, a Shack Burger SIngle which comes with lettuce, tomato and their special sauce. and a Shack Stack with is a cheese burger with a crisp fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese, lettuce, tomato and their special sauce!  I had a big bite of the Shack Burger and it was alright.  tasted nice, however it was NOT mouth watering to me. It did not perk up my senses to say, ahhh, I have arrived.  I was also surprised at the rather small size of the burger itself.  For me my main meal was the Shack Stack with both the meat and the mushroom.  When you bite into this, a gusher of warm melted cheese will ooze out and that was really great.  I found it really hard to taste the mushroom as it was fried and I thought for the longest time I had the wrong order as i could only see the mushroom and not the hamburger itself. It was there, just very thin and nearly non-existent.  I give this a three star overall for the fact that there was nothing remarkable about either burger.\n\nThe Fries - 2 Star - Much has been said about their crinkle fries, and their cheese fries. I would say that the fries were cooked just right, and at the same time, I must NOT be a fan of crinkle fries because I found myself missing the small, thin, crispy fries that many other places serve.  The cheese fries were highly recommended and it felt like someone had melted simple sliced cheese on the fries. I mean, the cheese to me had a processed taste to it. I did not get it, but you can betcha it was darn decent as I ate the entire THING!\n\nThe Bouncer - 5 star - They have a greeter at the front to give you a menu and to give you a quick idea of what to get. I thought the greeters were both amazing and very friendly!  Keep it up!\n\nFrozen Custard, Dogs, Concretes- I cannot comment as we did not order this or any of the concretes.  I will give this a 5 star because you know that when it warms up a bit, I am gonna go for the works on these puppies!\n\nCold Brew - 2 star - orderd the $4.75 Cold Brew, steeped and cold pressed iced coffee brewed and bottled in Brooklyn.  They serve it in a 10.5 oz bottle. Tasted like simply cold coffee and it came in a plastic cup with a lid. Definitely not a bottle, and definitely I did not say - \"Wow, how do you make that!\"  Instead, I said \"Wow, glad I did not order that\".   OK, actually I did, however for my son. \n\nI will be going back, as I cannot ignore all the yelpers who rave about this place. I maybe just was expecting something different.

{"text": "I was asked by Shake Shack to email them about my experience since I didn't rate them too well on my IG. I figure I'd copy and paste a portion of my email to them:\n\nI had gone earlier today to see what all the hype was about. I liked what I saw on the menu and wanted to order the double SmokeShack and was told that you had run out of bacon (it was roughly 11:30am). Fine. I also ordered one order of fries and a concrete shake (I forgot the name, but it included chocolate truffle cookie dough, which I was told was also out of stock). Fine. Replace it with peanut butter. My total was a tad over $19. $19? This better be the best burger in the world. That is WAY overpriced for any kind of burger meal.\n\nSo I wait and finally get my burger....\n\nWhere's the other patty? I went to the counter and notified them of their mistake. They apologized profusely and said they'd have my double right away. To my horror, however, they took the single and tossed it straight to the trash. A perfectly good burger. Apparently the profit margin is immense if your employees are willing to toss a perfectly good burger  away.\n\nI finally sit down with my double SmokeShack, minus the bacon. I bite into it and the burger was nicely seasoned. Nothing about the meat screamed \"unique\", as there was no special seasoning to differentiate it from your competitors. The peppers were a nice touch and the bread was light and airy (which could also be a detriment due to the burger's juices almost making it soggy). It wasn't amazing overall, but it wasn't terrible either. I would rate the burger a tad bit lower than an In n Out burger and better than a Five Guys burger. The fries were done well. The shake was ok too. \n\nWas it worth the $19 price tag? Hell no. The overall meal had the quality of a hole-in-the-wall, $8 meal. Speed of service and customer service quality is definitely not the issue. I was served quickly and politely, even though the line was long. It was the price, the lack of preparedness/ingredients, and the willingness to waste food so nonchalantly turned me off to the whole experience.\n\nMy friends had told me about the mushroom burger and how good it was.

{"text": "3.5 stars\n\nI have heard for a couple months that they were opening up a Shake Shack in Las Vegas at New York New York.  To my surprise, it had opened and my fiancee and I happened to be in Vegas that week for New Year's.  We weren't sure where it was actually located in the hotel because we tried using the map kiosk at the hotel and it just wasn't working for us.  So we walked outside, because I saw on some pictures posted it had an outside storefront.  So we walked around the outside of hotel, we found it!  I'll save you the trouble of having to walk outside in either the cold or the heat... in the casino walk towards the Swatch store use that exit to go outside.  There is also a casino exit you can use also which is closer.\n\nApparently, the day were went was opening day!  When we arrived, I was expecting a line out the door.  I have been to the NYC location in Battery Park and we waited in line for 30 mins.  And with it being their opening day the line could have been hitting the street.  We didn't have to wait too long there were in line less than 10 mins before we were able to order.\n\nWe ordered a double Shackburger, ShackMeister Dog, Cheese Fries, and a Black and White Shake (chocolate and vanilla).  The whole thing cost over $20.  We were looking for a table to sit, luckily two women were leaving and offered their table.  They give you a buzzer to let you know your food is ready.\n\nThe look of everything look almost the same as I remembered from the original but it has been a while since I've had it.  The food had good flavor but was on the salty side for our taste.  Would I call the best burger on the West Coast?  That can be debatable.  \n\nOn value, I think In-n-Out is better based on what you get for the price.  If you're simple, the flavor maybe too salty for your taste.  I liked the fact there wasn't extra bun with no meat at the end, many time I get that when we eat burgers.  This is a good sign the portions of bun to patty is perfect.  The location is better than the one in Battery Park, reasons being there is inside sitting and you don't have to deal with the NYC pigeons trying to steal your food!\n\nI would want to come here again to try their other burgers and other items on the menu.  This was their opening week so like many other eatery you have to work out some kinks to get it right at a new location.", "review_id": "7UAtuEJnp5dNE87EbuNvPg"}
{"text": "Another NYC staple right around my neighborhood!!  Stoked to actually have the first West Coast franchise in Las Vegas instead of elsewhere.  Conveniently situated on Las Vegas Blvd for those who happen to be galavanting around the Strip and in need of some place for a quick meal.  This, however, isn't the case for locals as trying to get here can be such a pain.  Parking alone is a 10-15 minute walk from either New York-New York or Monte Carlo, only to find yourself lining up amongst a large crowd once arriving at the establishment.  At least the queue went by relatively fast so the wait didn't take too long despite of the line being quite lengthy.\n\nUnlike other locations I've gone to, this spot has a C-Line which lets customers buying anything off the menu but food items bypass the regular line.  This serves as an excellent pit stop for frozen custards or even alcoholic beverages while strolling around the area.\n\nFood was just as great as the meal I had in NYC or MIA: seasoned burger patty topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce between pillowy potato bun.  People usually compare the burger from this place to other joints such as In-N-Out and Five Guys, but I have to say, I prefer the ones from here than the latter.  They also serve several beers on tap.  Perhaps my favorite is the ShackMeister which is made just for the company by Brooklyn Brewery.   \n\nOverall, Shake Shack is definitely one of the top fast food burger spots in town.

{"text": "Being generous with that extra star...\n\nSo I came here today after some raving reviews from a friend of mine. She likes this place over In-N-Out and it's super delicious blah blah blah.\n\nCame around 2pm to a short line outside and spoke to the usher guy outside who says he eats 4 of these things a day and brings then back home to his wife...so I start thinking...\"how big are these burgers?\". He explains how the menu works and all that good stuff.\n\nWent inside and waited in the second line and looked over the decor...I don't care...It's about the food. Just looked kinda hipster/umami-esq...No big deal.\n\nEnded up getting a single of the one with bacon and peppers while the gf got a single of their claim to fame (sorry I forget the names). I opted for the single because I couldn't get myself to spend 3 extra dollars for a 4oz meat patty. I got the Chicago style hot dog instead to try more of the menu and fries and topped it off with a concrete (kinda like a blizzard from DQ) with the strawberry and waffle pieces. Got a side of fries and bill came to $28 bucks....whoo...that's...a lot.\n\nGot the pager and waited a few...then got the food. \n\nFirst impressions: looks good. Kinda on the small side burger wise. I little smaller than In-N-Out but bigger patties. Gf has one tomato and one piece of lettuce, mine has a good amount of bacon and peppers. Nice crinkle fries and good looking concrete. Thought a single scoop is pretty small for the price. Chicago dog was Nathan's small but looked the part without the nuclear green relish.\n\nTaste: bacon was good and peppers had little bite. No lettuce or tomato for this...Kinda disappointed. Tasted good but not OMG best thing ever! Bread was like a mix of brioche and hawaiian and was split but not all the way so ended up like a pocket thing. Gf's was good but ordinary. Shack sauce was kinda lacking. Nothing special. The dog was good. Split and grilled. Good condiments but no casing so no \"snap\". The fries are great. Crinkle kept the crunch. Although...for a burger place that tries to exemplify organic and no GMO \"specialty\" burger place, I would have expected real potatoes...not some Sysco or Ore-Ida frozen potatoes for fries. The concrete was good. I liked that. The waffle pieces were crunchy and tasty. The strawberry was good and the ice cream was good. Note I say ice cream...not custard as they advertise. I've had frozen custard...and it had a certain consistency and smoothness and taste...totally different than froyo and ice cream..but this...this was ice cream.\n\nFinal thoughts: I'd come here for dessert. I think the burgers are WAY overpriced. $9 for a small double cheese burger is not worth it. You could get gourmet gastro pub type burgers (huge 1/2 or 1/3lb with all kinds of oddball toppings) for that price. They offer no \"combos\" to help out the pricing. Taste was mediocre. And comparing to major competitors, In-N-Out to me has more flavor, but if not even that...give more veggies and for $9 you can have 3 patties, real hand cut fries, and a drink. 5 guys has many toppings, homestyle taste, fresh cut fries, and a drink as well for around the same price. \n\nI was lucky I was in Vegas to try this place out where spending money comes easy. If it had been at home, I'd be very angry.", "review_id": "ordmuW5oisPOESYy4AW4fA"}

{"text": "I see a lot of people comparing shake shack to in n out and I'll be straight up about that in n out is still Better. Haha you could never compare the almighty in n out to anything. As far as Shake shack, the food reminded me of a Wendy's bacon burger but bigger non squar patties and better taste. Only thing that made it different was the cherry peppers and sauce. But watch if u think you'll be like damn this guy is right. I had smoke shack double and fries and wasn't full after, Im literally going order more food bc I wasn't that impressed. Heard so much hype about this spot but it was nothing orgasmic or like made me wanna react like this a miracle of a burger. Mind you this based on what I ate. I didn't try any desserts or anything else. The pricing is way overpriced probably because it's founded in New York. I'm west coast born and raised so I'll always be biast. If I visited New York again I would not go out of my way to go to shake shack, I bet no one has said that yet... That alone should change ur mind. This is suppose to be a New York staple and it was whatever. I spent 15 dollars on a burger, fries, and drinks that alone ruined my appetite. Pricing is mayb more then New York to bc its on the strip. Who knows ..the pricing sucked for what your getting. Don't get me wrong the burger was a bomb ass burger cooked medium well...but damn 9.49 for a double burger...2.95 for freezer fries..2.25 for reg soda that was the size of a water cup.I thought this was suppose to be fast food not a restaurant I don't know what it was but mayb I should of asked for sauces on the side to dip in or customize my burger... Something to make me feel like I didn't get ripped off......... \n\nWell round two let's see what's up. Hopefully this time it redeems my first experience. Ok round two was ten times better then my first round. Get the shack stack and a concrete and don't mess with anything else. That burger alone did it for me. Might be one of the best burgers I've ever had tell u the truth. So if your a shroom lover its on", "review_id": "4gPI8Yft3lTnelS-aSvImw"}

{"text": "We had stayed in Vegas for New Year's weekend and saw that New York New York had finished remodeling their new strip sidewalk with the new Hershey store and some restaurants including Shake Shack. We've heard of the name before so we wanted to try it out. \n\nShake Shack just opened before New Year's day so outside there was an introductory line where a guy handed out menus and introduced the items they had to offer. He briefed us on their purpose to use \"all natural premium ingredients\" with no hormones, etc. Briefly looking over the menu we see prices are a bit high than we are used to but it's okay, we're thinking it better be good cause we'd be comparing them to other popular burger joints like Umami Burger and Slater's 50/50.\n\nService was efficient; we had gotten our food without much wait. The condiments counter was simple with utensils, lids, ketchup/mustard, and water. I wish they had the sport peppers on the counter that they use in their dog, which I'll get to in a bit. Chairs and tables here remind me of Mendocino Farms in L.A.; they're made from recycled and sustainable materials. Everything about this joint reminds me that they're trying to do good for the environment and our health. Hipster, as they call it?\n\nThe presentation of the food was cute. Each burger fit in a paper sleeve and hot dog and crinkle cut fries sat in small trays. Having said that, we were disappointed in the size of our meal especially for the price we had paid. It's all quality over quantity here so you gotta give up some of your wins from gambling! However, the taste of the burgers were mediocre. I had the single ShackBurger and my bf had the SmokeShack (yes these are registered trademarks already). The ShackBurger was a simple cheese burger with one leaf of lettuce and one slice of tomato. Pretty minimal that I couldn't even taste the ShackSauce (spread). The SmokeShack was a bit better with cherry peppers but nothing really stood out. Turns out they were originally a hot dog stand in New York so it was a good thing my boyfriend ordered a Shackago dog too. This was pretty good with the toppings placed perfectly in and outside the split dog. The sport peppers was really what gave this dog a kick! We had all three concretes: Shack Attack, Jackpot, and All Shook Up, but nothing was that great about it either. I've had better concretes elsewhere.\n\nFor now, I think I'd only go back for their hot dogs which isn't much of a selection; neither is their burger choices. Also I'd like to note that their burgers and fries are good because of the quantity of oil they use. Cheese burgers and cheese fries on top of that? To me, that just sounds unhealthy too. So for being a proponent of eating natural, non-GMO, and all that crap, Shake Shack should consider adding much more veggies and using less oil in their items.

It was nothing spectacular and there weren't fireworks on my tongue haha I have gone to the one in central park in new york and I remember that one being real good.

When I had arrived, I was expecting some what of a line but I seriously just walked right on up to the register and ordered our burgers. Some of the burgers have a shack sauce that reminded me of in n out, but this sauce is much saltier than I remember. Nothing beats the in n out secret sauce  \n\nOverall, the burgers we got basically tasted like something  that I could have concocted at home. Just cook some meat, fry some bacon, melt some cheese and voila! You have a shake shack burger. The sauce was salty and I felt it had overpowered the taste of my burger. I had to drink two cups of Dr pepper to help with it. The krinkle fries were good tho! You can't mess up potatoes!

{"text": "My husband and I were planning to find gelato at Monte Carlo, but on our walk from NYNY to Monte Carlo, we saw this new place and was attracted by the fact that they use hormone/antibiotics free beef for burger, so we changed course and decided to try this place instead of getting gelato. \n\nWe went around dinner time at night on a Tuesday and it was packed. Long line, a lot of occupied tables.\nI had the double hamburger, my husband got a single hamburger, and we shared a concrete (vanilla frozen custard with strawberry puree). I like the burger a lot. I specifically asked them if they cook the patty with nut oil or soy oil and they said no, so it is awesome for me due to my allergy. And I also didn't get the shack sauce as there is soy in it. I like the burger as it is simply beef flavor. I am actually the type who don't like too many things going on making me not tasting the beef. I eat beef for liking the beef taste, not the condiment. So I like the way they do it, fits my need. And the burger is a bit greasy which I have no problem with, I like beef patty having the beef fat taste, I hate those that has plant oil taste. It is just my preference and they happened to fit my need. I also can tell the difference in taste for hormone free beef and conventional beef. I don't like the taste of the beef that was raised with hormones or antibiotics. So another reason I like the taste of shake shack burger.\n\nWe both like the concrete, the dairy tasted fresh and soft, the texture was good, the creaminess was right, good consistency, I was so glad that I had this instead of gelato. \n\nI know I can probably make the same quality of beef patty at home as long as I go to Whole Foods to get the hormone free or even organic beef. But honestly, when you eat out, the reason is that you don't have time to cook or even do dishes, or you are on the street being hungry and need to be fed right away. So I can't say that it is not special because I could probably make the same thing at home. The price is not bad too. And I got to eat the way I want without cleaning all the grease splattering around my stove and countertop. And I don't think I have the stamina to make fresh ice cream daily myself too though I am capable. So yah, I recommend this place if you are like me who don't eat conventional beef or dairy. I like every bite I had here. \n\nA note for people who have allergy. Their fries are made with just potato, no additives, but fried in soy oil, so if you have soy allergy, don't do fries then. The hot dog is also made with hormone free, antibiotic free meat, and there is no nitrite or nitrate, we are gonna try the hot dog next time when we are around the area. If you have allergy, tell the cashier so he/she can tell you what items you shouldn't try.", "review_id": "mGSIJstiPfuy7Z-yLDtCsg"}

I'm in love with their brioche bun which is very soft and moist, and the bun is not cut across all the way so when ur eating the ingredients are not going to fall out the other side, genius!

The Shack burger will come with cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce, but if u want to add pickles or onions, they most definitely can. The cheese fries sauce are hot when they are served to you which makes it so much better, it's sort of similar to a nacho cheese. \n\nThere are of course tables to sit at but there are also some lounge areas without a table.

If the tickets were a little cheaper I would go again, but now it's off my bucket list, i'm not going back. A lot of work and thought went into this event, nicely done and great staff. Bring a jacket, it's cold throughout. Bring the kids, it's more for them. I was told it was targeted to the adults, but that was lack-lustered for my tastes. First room they have you stand in front of a green screen for a picture, but give you no input on how or what it is for, they need to put samples of the three backdrop pictures up front so you can have a small idea of the finish product. They have cafe food on-site, which we didn't try, there is a lot to take in, you can spent a quite of a bit of time just reading everything. Yes there are restrooms inside (outside) available. My biggest disappointment is that I was expecting props from the Marvel movies, and backdrops, more museum type pieces, there was none. The simulators that held my interest were the 'Holo-Blaster Training Simulator' and the 'Black Widow Agility Maze'. There was an 'Avengers Encounter' that would not work at all for me, maybe because I was wearing dark clothes and black jacket, so the computer had a hard time in seeing my movements, not sure. At times it just seemed 'hokey', good-hearted but hokey, and you reflect on the money you spent to walk through. The Marvel Experience collects a LOT of information about you, and get ready to input your email address in their interactive displays everywhere. I own a couple restaurants and maybe I should start charging a $10 per car fee since you're already spending money at my place?

First, let's talk about how we almost didn't make it because Hero Ventures and TicketMaster never got their act together.  When they postponed opening the event for a week, we did not get any information about our NEW tickets.  All they did was mention that we could bring a friend for free.  All that this did was add to the total number of disappointed attendees today.\n\nWe arrived and were very much surprised by a heretofore unmentioned charge for parking.  Not once was it referenced in any of the communications, or on the page for the event.  Ten additional dollars poorer, we then waited for thirty to forty five minutes, in the sun, while other attendees tried futilely to register their less than useless tracker bracelets.  The wait would still have been a long time, even if EVERYONE had pre-registered, because none of the pre-registration credentials were being recognized.  However, the wait was even LONGER because only fifty five to sixty percent of the kiosks were working, and only forty five to fifty of them working completely.\n\nWe were then treated to spending huge amounts of time standing and waiting.  The shortest wait, after the registration debacle, was twenty minutes before getting to the \"Interactive\" area.  This consisted mostly of cheesy games (more at home at Castles and Coasters than a groundbreaking technological marvel) that had simply been reskinned with Marvel characters. But, most of the Marvel Experience was the waiting.  Waiting for the \"3-D\" and the \"4-D\" experiences.  Both of these were notable lacking in at least one advertised dimension. The 3-D Projection wasn't even working, so the glasses they handed us were handed right back.  This after a forty five to fifty minute wait.  The wait to go from the \"3-D\" part to the \"4-D\" ride was only twenty to twenty five minutes... But, also NO 3-D!!!\n\nSo we spent two and a half hours getting less than half of what we paid for.  The only thing this had in common with Marvel was the name, as well as the waiting that Marvels dedicated fans do.  But, at least that waiting pays off in dividends of great comics, movies and TV series.  The \"Marvel Experience\" was the waiting but, it was only followed by profound disappointment.\n\nAlso, the staff couldn't have been more disorganized and I'll-informed if they were the voting public.\n\nThis event was an over-hyped, under-delivered, bad faith rip-off.

The lines were extremely long to get in and once inside there were lines for everything!!!  Picture disney lines and multiply that by 10 and then only to arrive to things that you can do at other places like the laser maze, or a climbing wall. The better things were not working well at all.  The wrist bands were lame and not functional, the 3d and 4d movies were not 3d at all.  The total experience was terrible and I ended up apologizing to my family from out of the country to have taken them there on their vacation.  My kids say they would only go back if they got paid.  As for me, they would for sure have to pay me a lot to go back.  I highly recommend putting all of the employees through the experience because many of them could not explain how it worked or what would be next, also, you need to manage the lines a lot better, and of course get the technology to work.  The idea is good but the execution is very poor. I also have requested a refund.  Do not waste your time.

From a distant the tent looks like Baymax laying on the floor. Haha. Surprisingly, parking on the dirt road was $10 (luckily we had cash on hand). \n\nWe tried to register our wrist bands which was a waste of time because the machines kept messing up due to the sunlight. As I scanned my band to participate in the activities, another person's information appeared instead of my own. Fail. \n\nThe most exciting part of the experience was the \"training\" area. Since we went the first day, the lines weren't as long and all of the machines were functioning. They didn't function very well (Iron Man and Hulk training activity), but they still worked. The laser maze and rock wall were the best training activities, but I felt like I could have done the rock wall at a real rock climbing gym. \n\nOur mortal bodies grew weak. We needed sustenance! And everything was overpriced (as expected) and tasted worst than Subway. \n\nThe second part of the training dealt with learning about several villains such as Red Skull and Madame Hydra. It was kind of... Dumb. We couldn't really hear the interactive screens that gave brief infos about each villains because of the loud music and chattering going on around us. \n\nAs we proceeded into the 3D dome area, we pretty much strained our necks as we had to look up the whole time while the show was projected onto the ceiling.

{"text": "STAY AWAY! Save your money and get more Christmas presents for your family. I had purchased the 99.00 VIP pass.

How did I like the Marvel experience? It sucked. Entering the training room was like going to a Chuck E cheese with 1/2 the games not working. Then you would self guide yourself to another room where you watched a short animated cartoon. The last room...the 4D room...is a room set up theatre style where you sit and watch a cartoon and your seat shakes and you get an occasional gust of air blown on you.

{"text": "Let me start by telling you what they got right - the story is good and relies on comic book lore that goes a little deeper than the cinematic universe. There is one moment near the end that genuinely brought a smile to my face which I won't ruin for you, and the staff seemed like they genuinely wanted to help. However, none of that can make up for the complete disorganization and technical malfunction we experienced.\n\nI was part of the 10:00am Saturday group that others have written about. First, we spent 45 minutes trying to register our wristbands on malfunctioning kiosks, which was made especially painful by the fact that the wristbands didn't seem to work at all and that the registration served no purpose.\n\nWe moved through the first two domes in a long line but without any specific problems. When we got into the first experience dome, what others have referred to as the arcade dome, we began to see clearly that the experience was not ready for the public. We were told that the Iron Man flight simulator didn't work, only to see people using about an hour later with a long line. We waited 30 minutes to get into the laser shooting gallery, only to have it malfunction when we went inside, where they left us standing in the dark for 15 minutes before unceremoniously being told to leave. The only functioning exhibit we were able to experience was the reconstructing the adaptoid, which was ok but not anywhere near the entertainment we expected for the price of admission. By the time we left this room we we were already frustrated.\n\nWe then moved onto the vestibule for the next exhibit, where we waited for another 30 minutes for the next dome, where we were told 110 people were 'stuck'. When we finally moved inside, they passed out 3D glasses and we were told we would begin our training. Moments later, they told us to take off the glasses because the 3D wasn't working anyway. The 2D animated movie was ok, and might have been awesome in 3D but who knows. Most of the people I was with ceased being able to follow the story at this point anyway.\n\nThe next chamber in between training and the climax was good, and actually the best part of our experience, which I won't ruin for anyone. If the rest of the exhibit had worked as well I wouldn't be complaining.\n\nMost insulting was the '4D' ride at the end. They took our malfunctioning wrist bands before we entered, and throughout the presentation it became clear that we would have been participating if we had them. There were no '4D' effects beyond what you could get in a flight simulator at Dave and Busters. The movie was not in 3D.\n\nThe store at the end looked like it had some nice, unique merchandise, but we were so irritated and angry we just rushed through it and left, not interested in spending even one more dollar.\n\nI spent $215 dollars on 4 adult and 2 child's tickets and $10 for parking for an experience that left me sad, dissapointed, and angry. I had high hopes for this. I have since learned that some people have been offered refunds or passes to return when they have things working, but no one has reached out to us despite our attempts to contact them. The uneven reimbursement just adds insult to injury.\n\nUPDATE: I was contacted and offered a refund, which Ticketmaster processed right away, so kudos to the Marvel Experience and Hero Ventures for doing the right thing.", "review_id": "YUQ04SIVPIHF95yrAnX5Eg"}

{"text": "Extremely disappointing and frustrating experience.  Highlights:\n\n- $10 unexpected parking fee \n\n- Before we entered we were told by staff that food or drinks were not allowed on the premises, \"No exceptions.\" I learned that, actually, both were allowed, but only if you paid for them inside. When we did purchase food and drinks ($40 worth), we were never advised that we could not proceed into other domes with said food and drinks.\u00a0 At dome 3, the staff told us we had to throw away everything,\u00a0 which included the souvenir cups, before we could proceed (it's worth noting the concession stand is RIGHT NEXT TO dome 3). \n\n- The work I put in to pre register for the event (a laborious task due to a poor Web experience) was useless because the kiosks to activate/link profiles to your provided band didn't work. Also, I learned from a manager that the wristbands that were sent to AZ were not the ones they originally tested the experience with.  The wristbands did not work at all,\u00a0 and they we're eventually taken away from us by staff outside the level 3 dome because \"they're vey defective,\" as one employee told me. \n\n- Staff activated each interactive game with random bands (I guess some actually worked?)...But this seemed to cause issues with the sensors that read body height; all but one of the games functioned poorly.\n\n- None of the 3D features worked,\u00a0 and we were told they would not work until Tuesday (3 days after our purchased event date). Very upsetting considering 3D features were advertised as part of the Marvel Experience. \n\n- Waiting times to enter domes were extreme (it took our group 40 minutes to enter the the Level 3 dome because the staff said they were fixing technical issues). Another 30 min for the 4D. Btw, why was it considered 4D if I'm watching a 1D movie on a big screen (no 3D glasses here), while sitting on a motion seat? \n\n- At the end of the event,\u00a0 I was asked by a staff member how was my experience.\u00a0 I gave my candid feedback and his reply literally was,\u00a0 \"Well, at least you didn't pay $180 bucks per ticket like some other people.\" Because...that's supposed to make me feel better? \n\n- Sidebar: Is it just me or did I not see one piece of merchandise in the shop that featured a female character (even though they were featured in the videos throughout the experience). Male characters only for sale. That doesn't seem very balanced.\n\n- Further frustrated,  I asked who is on site to manage the whole experience.  I was told it depends... There's someone managing VIP, food, tickets,  and technology.  I asked for anyone who can make changes.  Strangely,  they send me to the ticketing manager.  When I provided my feedback I learned: no one really knows who or to what extent staff was trained (some staff admitted to me they hadn't been thru the experience), the wrong bands were sent to AZ, there isn't time for anything to fix things because \"we go from 9 am to 11 pm everyday and there's no time to figure anything out,\" AZ was more of a \"test ground,\" and the 3D won't be fixed until Tuesday,  after someone is flown in to fix it. \n\n- If you want a refund (I'm sure you will), I learned you have to request it through TicketMaster.\n\nBoo.", "review_id": "-ZTWCw2sjGJ3GH_I88Y8Fw"}

Then you move on to the next tent where you AGAIN WAIT and WAIT to watch some trite Sunday morning cartoons.\n\nThe worst part of this is the way this is set up. THERE IS NO WAY TO LEAVE - you have to go through this gauntlet of boredom and tackiness to exit.  I seriously thought about using the emergency doors, no joke here. We couldn't wait for this NIGHTMARE to end. We couldn't get the hell out of there fast enough. \n\nWhoever came up with this, started with this question. How can I separate bunch of fools from their money while putting least amount of effort? I disagree with previous reviewers in that the poor experience was due to technical difficulties. The poor experience is due to fundamentally flawed design at every level. Almost everything there from plot of the story, cartoon design, organization, the attractions inside the tent, the 4D ride seems to be an afterthought. Something thrown together hastily and on the cheap. There were few set pieces that look nice... but that's not even worth the trip.\n\nWhat they excelled at was how to extract your cash. Starting with the overpriced tickets, parking, photo opportunities, way overpriced cafe and the classic exit through the gift shop. Now If your cash wasn't enough they also have you input personal information under guise of obtaining your \"agent\" ID cards. Sadly you never get a physical ID and in retrospect this was just a way to gather your personal information  be resold for even bigger profit. It's just SICKENING. \n\nShame on Marvel. I actually enjoyed most of of their movies. Now every time I see Iron Man or Captain America I seriously cringe. I am definitely will not be seeing any more of the upcoming Marvel movies in the theatre or purchase any merchandise.

In the end, the games showed me up as some 8 yr old white kids.  \n\nThe Hulk game and Iron man game were not even sync or calibrated.  Whats the point of waiting in line to training and no be able to do anything except crash into the mountain or not even move the hulk.  You should invest in a XBOX.  At least they know how to get those game working\n\nThe only good game was the laser black widow game.  Too bad you only had 1 of them and it also had the longest line.  What were you thinking?\n\nThe 3D?  Really?  First of all, it didnt work or wasn't 3D to begin with.  Then we had to keep looking at the done.  Why not just tell us to lay down on the floor?  It would have been better than have to keep our neck in that uncomfortable position.\n\nThe 4D?  Great, still no 3D but now our seat gets some movement.

The only difference between the regular VIP and Level 9 VIP was a small cheap spiderman action figure. THAT IS IT. Supposedly you get a custom figure from the gift shop, but none of the employees knew what it was so we didn't get it. The \"VIP Lounge\" which we all had access to was a small crappy tent with 2 small couches, and the VIP food consisted of small cups of fruit, vegetables, and popcorn. Not what we expected for the price. The VIP bathroom they advertise is only next to the VIP lounge tent, so with the exception of the first 10 minutes you are there, you will be using the regular bathrooms with everyone else. \n\nNothing seems to work, not even the employees\nMost of the employees didn't seem to know what was going on. It took us almost an hour to even get access. Some employees were in character, calling you a recruit and acting as if it was all real, but most of them were apathetic and disinterested, and our VIP concierge was even texting on her phone. The wristbands you get at the beginning are supposed to be programmed with your information so that when you are in training, you scores can be recorded. BUT the machines that you use to register your information were broken when we were there, so our characters were just \"First Name Last Name\". The training modules used Kinect to detect your movements, and often did not register when you were doing something. When I played the Iron Man game, it did not once register any of my movements. When I complained to one of the employees, she said it just doesn't read some people. Umm..Okay? Not what I wanted to hear after waiting in line for 30 minutes to play this game.\n\nIt just goes from bad to worse\nAfter you complete your training, you go to a dome-shaped tent to receive your mission. It is projected on the ceiling of the tent, and you are told to sit on the dirty carpeted floor to watch it. If this sucked for me, I'm sure this sucked for the older people there who brought their grandchildren. The transitions between each experience thereafter are unnecessarily long and you will find that you spend a large portion of your time just standing and waiting. Keep in mind, this is after the 2.5 hours you spent in the training room, waiting for 30 minutes at a time in line for each activity. When you do finally get to the final chamber where you, one of the recruits, are needed to save the day, you are asked to lift your arm band to save the day, only to realize they took your armband. You will then go to the giftshop where you see more employees in this one room than you saw in the entire event, and they follow you as you walk around the giftshop to make sure you aren't stealing anything.

I figured having a check in time would help eliminate the crowd but it was a waste of our time.", "review_id": "tk6_cVCjqSaeuYZwWfPwJQ"}

{"text": "DO. NOT. WASTE. YOUR. MONEY.\n\nI know what you're thinking: How bad could this be? No way Marvel would endorse something that isn't 100% awesome. This must be a guy who went on the first day when they had glitches, it has to have gotten so much better since then. \n\nDon't do it. Marvel really duped us on this one. There are two decent activities to participate in (a shooting game and a maze) but both require a full hour wait and last only a few minutes at best. The rest of the area has very little interactivity. I went several days after the opening night and everything was working, nothing was out of service. Despite that, my kids (7 and 9) were bored the entire night. \n\nThe 3D/4D graphic shows were cool, but they were very brief and not at all worth the $150 we paid for a family of 5. I'd love to have time travel as a super power so I could go back and tell myself not to waste the money or the time.

Also, while some may say it is not fair to compare something like this to \"Disneyland\", I disagree.  Disney as the parent company who has \"theme park\" entertainment down to a science would never settle for the poorly executed design and management of this experience to exist.  No reason to re-invent the wheel- pool resources from the Disney parks gurus and fix the kinks.  Several of the activities inside the experience are actual activities AT Disneyland (in the Innoventions attraction in Tomorrowland) so there should be zero \"kinks\" with those, yet there are.\n\nCost: For our family of 4 (2 adults 2 teens) we paid $145 for the Marvel Experience plus an additional $10 for parking and shelled out another $20 for a souvenir photo.  So at $175 we are not talking about chump change.\n\nTime: We had tickets for Sunday December 28th at 3pm- the web said the experience would last 90-120 minutes. We were there for 3.5 hours ( i.e. 210 minutes) from 2:45pm until 6:15pm.  Approximately 60 minutes of that was actual \"experience\" everything else was standing in line.\n\nWould we do it again?:\nnot likely- at least not at the cost that it was.  Again it was nearly $30 per person\n\nPros:  It's Marvel so if you like Marvel you will be able to find something to like about it.\n\nCons: 1-interestingly enough kids 6 and under were FREE- which blows my mind because there sure were a TON of them and they take up a TON of time on the activities that those of us that PAID to be there are now having to wait for.  Due to the structure of the activities I believe every person who enters should be a paying ticket holder that would make it fair. 2- parking was an additional $10 (if you ever go to anything at Talking Stick you KNOW you have to pay for parking, this just always sucks- but at $10 per event they need to PAVE that lot- the dirt is getting old) 3- poor crowd management (read full review for details) 4- low value high cost (see full review for details of what $30 per person gets you)", "review_id": "KsTP4yKnAVlxgHYYAIqb0A"}

{"text": "I know what The Marvel Experience feels like whenever I've gone and seen a Marvel movie. Fun, excitement, laughter. All joyous emotions. I felt none of that during this experience. This was just flat out horrible on many levels. \n\nI avoided the dreaded $10 parking fee that others encountered. When I went with a buddy of mine Sunday night it was pretty dead. Guess the bad word of mouth had made it thru by then. \n\nThe staff was just so blah. No excitement or enthusiasm of any kind. But I will say that it was at night so maybe they are just tired from repeating the same stuff over and over.\n\nThe \"interactive\" stuff isn't much. It felt very cheap and that they were thinking. Let's just slap the name Marvel on it and people will love it. The Spider-man wall climb was just a regular rock climbing wall that moved. Would it have killed them to make a rock climbing wall that looked like the side of a high rise building? Or something like a magnet or velcro suit that let's u stick to walls? Dome 1 mostly consisted of monitors that had the origins of the characters which were all covered many times before in Marvel movies and cartoons. And the noise level of the dome drowned out the sound of the televisions, so you couldn't hear anything anyways. The \"museum\" was a joke. I was thinking it was a hall of Marvel history with props from some of the actual movies. All the props looked like plastic toys you could get a any toy store. Most of the games didn't work right. The holo simulator was ok, but it felt cheap. As far as computer animation has come along the graphics for the heroes in dome 1 was very lackluster. \n\nThe Quinjet that was advertised so much as a life size one that you wouldn't believe it was all one piece. Was just pretty much a wing. There was no cockpit or seats or anything like that. Just more monitors telling you about the origins of the villains.\n\nThey took away our initial bracelets when we reached Dome 2 and I for one have no idea why they gave them to us to begin with. Cause they told us when we first walked in that those bracelets they gave us didn't work. It just made no sense at all. The 3d movie was cool but it ends right when it starts getting good with no conclusion and the staff ushers you right into the next room. The 4d ride was fun for what it was. But again without those bracelets working the part where they want you to interact falls flat. \n\nThe gift shop was full of overpriced items and not many things to choose from.  It consisted of a certain amount of items just spaced out in different parts of the gift shop. \n\nAll in all for $37 its a major ripoff. I would feel like a straight idiot if I paid for the VIP package. The games are the same type of games you would find in a Peter Piper. You would think they would have people dressed up in character costumes walking around the place for photo ops. And it basically focus on The Avengers. If its a true Marvel experience where were all the hundreds of characters that they have in their library?\n \nIf your a 5 year old kid. This place is a blast. I got excited when I first pulled up to the place and I saw those huge domes all glowing and the music blaring. But if your a true Marvel fan thinking your going to go into the mecca of the world of Marvel universe. You'll come out very very VERY disappointed.", "review_id": "thZbEqmKqfhB7uHyW_ie-Q"}

Overall the group running it mentioned several things were not right, like the screen printed poster not being available (part of VIP), the 3D not working on something's , and the RFID wrist band, what's with that?

{"text": "I agree with others that this would have been more entertaining and fun if I were younger. \n\nI knew there would be many children, so I went in with that expectation. In reality, the adults and teenagers were much harder to deal with. Two forty-something year old women stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and they shouted as if they were at a concert. They would not shut up about every little thing they observed and kept butting into other people's conversations. Long story short...these kinds of events attract idiots and people of all walks of life. So brace yourself for an airport-like experience.\n\nThe entire event was rather boring and full of long lines. It focused on the Avengers characters; but for political correctness, they threw in the Black Panther and the \"strong woman type\" She-Hulk. \n\nNone of the registration kiosks were open. So it seems they never fixed their IT issues. The technology is a bit dated, and to be honest a lot of the interactive games were of same quality as DisneyQuest in Chicago (closed since 2001). Seeing the Cox logo on a screen was in bad taste. I'm surprised I didn't see more sponsorship logos around. \n\nIt's not worth the drive, headache, or money to go.

Unfortunately the day was far from pleasant. It began by not going in at our scheduled time, but over an hour later. We tried to relax with soda and water as the sun beat down on us, only to find the concession stand had only room temperature drinks! We were also unable to register our wrist bands which made the experience not quite as immersive during the \"training\" as I felt like I saw just \"First Player\". There were long lines for each activity and game, and the staff didn't seem to care much about it instead goofing with their phones, ignoring my questions, and talking with other employees about non work related activities. And the games and activities did not work or respond well at all. We finally gave up to go in to more hurry up and wait lines to see the 3D dome. the sound was so muffled we couldn't understand half the dialogue.  Then came more hurry up and wait while we waited for the ride. The ride itself wasn't bad though and unfortunately the only thing that went well. Even the gift shop area seemed poorly managed by employees that were more interested in talking to girls that were obviously much younger than them and \"checking them out.\"\n\nI felt as if I wasted my ticket money and spent it for overpriced warm drinks, poor staffing, and standing in line for 4 hours of my day.

{"text": "Don't. Just don't. Every horrible thing people have said on here is 100% true. I read reviews before going but kept thinking that it couldn't really be that bad. Trust me, it is. I'm not technologically advanced as far as 3D and 4D so I was sure that those things would interest me and seem cool. Wrong. It was sooooo bad. Let me lay out my complaints for you, one by one.\n\n1)We went on 12/30 at 11:30 am. It was hot in the main dome. Uncomfortably so. This is AZ people. Even in the winter, the sun shines. Have adequate a/c and ventilation ready.\n\n2)The lines. For heaven's sake, the lines. I've stood in shorter lines at Disneyland. Not too mention after you stand in each line the game lasts no more than a minute. So I just stood there for 45 minutes to be entertained for 60 seconds.\n\n3)Broken stuff. The registration booths were broken but they still gave you these stupid bracelets to wear. They did absolutely nothing. Nothing. Try to explain that to a 5 year old who wanted to scan his bracelet at every game or exhibit we went to. Also that day one of Spiderman's climbing \"walls\" (these were a freaking joke) were down as was some of the Ironman games.\n\n4)The expense. I took my 5 year old so he was free. Which was good because if he wasn't I would have been asking for my money back. Everything inside was overpriced, just like the ticket itself. They had a souvenir popcorn bucket for $10. You'd think for that price it would be something cool, printed with characters and stuff on it. No. It was a white bucket that said The Marvel Experience in black. That's it. \n\n6)The 3D/4D portion. Both the movie and ride were ridiculous. For the movie you had to stand in this dome and crane your neck up to watch it on the ceiling. You weren't allowed to sit and watch this. No, that would make too much sense. Same for the ride except you were sitting in a vibrating chair for that one. It was still uncomfortably high on the ceiling. And you can only ride the ride once. This should be said with a huge disclaimer before you buy the tickets. Sure, it was kind of lame but if I had been able to ride it more than once it might have lessened the blow. \n\nOverall my 5 year old loved it. I can't imagine anyone over the age of 5 loving it though. He thought the ride was cool. It's just too bad we could only ride it once. If it came back next year I definitely wouldn't take him unless the prices the went down and everything else went up.", "review_id": "QbIlwOVjsxyPiP2wUl8QJQ"}

If you have little kids (under 8 maybe), they might like it but unless you have a lot of money to waste it probably wouldn't be worth finding out. A lot of the attractions are not very accurate. There's one where you strike a pose and you summon a superhero based on your pose. 8 out of 10 people would change their pose and summon the same superhero. Also, there's nowhere to sit. You wait in line after line and nowhere to sit. By the end, we were excited for the sitting ride. That actually was a cool part; really, the only cool part.

What I got was a bunch of displays of plastic that didn't do anything, a line to play a shooter game that would be better on the wii, which then proceeded to a five minute dome movie that was a cartoon, and a three minute simulation ride, where the seat moved, again with a cartoon.    And that was it...   no amazing interaction with the marvel characters, no four dimensional holograms that brought you into the action, no 360 degree movie experience to make you feel like you were there...

I am a  fairly new Marvel fan and went with someone who is a [middle-aged] Marvel fan. The VIP tickets might have been a better bet IF I could have afforded them (about $100/ticket).  The \"hyper reality\" is just HYPE. Poorly executed event, to say the least. The lines were incredibly long and once you got to do or see something, it only lasted a couple minutes. We only got to do three things in our 3 hours there! We stood in line for one 3D event for over an hour and the even took just 2 minutes. In our experience, there were numerous equipment malfunctions and glitches, so many kinks have to be worked out yet. We went on 12/30 so assumed any issues would have been fixed by then, but nope! The staff was poorly trained and at times, many of them did not seem to have any management or guidance around. A couple staff members completely ignored us when we asked questions, and others simply did not know or seem to care. \nOH and let me mention the $10 parking fee that they don't bother to tell you until you show up. Sadly we did not have cash on us and ended up being late to the ticket start time. Not a big deal in the end because at our 5pm start time we stood in line and waited for almost 20 minutes before being let in.\nAt the end of the event you get a free cheap plastic bracelet for completing and passing the Shield training and becoming a Shield recruit, whatEVER. Also at the end is a souvenir store where you can pay for overpriced this and that. Walk right on out folks.\nThis was a partial Christmas gift to someone I care about. I think it's safe to say we both felt let down. The hype says this event is geared to older kids and adults, however, it was clearly set up for younger kids, and kids under 6 were apparently free. Really young kids were the only one who seemed to enjoy it. And of course, food and beverage prices were astronomical.

I stopped in around 10:00am that day and picked out half a dozen to share with friends.  The establishment itself is bright and clean and reminds me of another favorite donut place in the northwest part of town.  The two friendly ladies behind the counter with their cute donut chef hats greeted me when I walked in.  There is a fairly wide selection to choose from including mini and regular sized croissant donuts, fritters, glazed, twists, donut holes, crullers, etc.  I didn't see any blueberry donuts.  I left with two mini cronuts, a mini apple fritter, a cinnamon crumb, a glazed, a sugar twist, and two donut holes thrown in for free, all for $6.95.  Of that selection, I was very impressed with the cinnamon crumb, which really is my favorite type of donut.  It wasn't dry at all, which is usually the case at other places.  It tasted like a moist piece of cinnamon cake in the shape of a donut; I would go back just for that and the apple fritter.  Now, I'm not usually a fritter fan and that's why I got the mini version, but, wow, Ace Donuts makes the best one I've had.  It wasn't greasy or oily, just fritterlicious.  My friends ended up eating the rest of the donuts and, truth be told, I didn't even try the cronuts because I don't like them with filling.\n\nMy second visit was the very next day, January 1, 2015, with the b/f and our pals; their first time and what better way to start the new year, right?  I only had one donut that time, though, and it was a cinnamon crumb cronut--score for me!  I liked it very much.  I was raving to the boyfriend about the fritter, though, so I made sure we got one to go that we shared later and he also agreed that it was amazing.  We should have gotten the regular sized one.  I need to go back soon and try the blueberry fritter as others have been singing its praises, too.

OUTSTANDING! Prawns are HUGE, butterflied & filled w/ cream cheese, and wrapped with a crispy slice of bacon saturated in sweet chili. Order this, or you're missing out on the obvious WINNER here! And don't worry, it's not spicy in the slightest.\n\nRolled Angus NY Strip w/ Asparagus ($14): Provolone, Basil, Sun-Dried Tomato & Marsala Mushroom Sauce. Excellent, thin sliced TENDER beef, pairing so well with the sun dried tomato & mushroom. Recommended!\n\nSmoked Salmon Carpaccio ($13): Truffle Vinaigrette & Capers. Thinly sliced fish with just a hint of truffle fragrance. Very enjoyable!\n\nSteamed Green Lip Mussels ($13): White Wine Tomato Broth & Garlic Bread. Tender shellfish in a creamy tomato broth, a bit mild in flavor, asking for a hint of salt/cheese to set it off.\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries ($8). Good amount of truffle oil, but towards the bottom pile, became hidden behind a plethora of SALT & salty cheese. It's been a long time since I've considered a fry almost too salty lol.\n\nMarinated Olives ($8). All pitted for easy consumption, the large green olives were delicate and flavorful...the smaller Kalamata olives with a considerable amount of vinegar.\n\nTruffle Mac & Cheese ($8). Well cooked pasta, nice cheese ratio and sharing size, but without a hint of truffle oil.\n\nBaked Chicken Wings ($9). Good flavor, but missing the nice crunchy consistency found in the preferred fried variety.\n\nLamb Gyro Cheesesteak ($11): Roast Peppers & Onions, Provolone & Peppadews. Bread cut too shallow, leaving a dense waste of carbs at bottom. The lamb was flavorful, but hidden between that same bread...I'd pass on this.\n\nAnd for dessert:\n\nAl's Cheesecake ($6). Very creamy cake, bubbly and light. It was enjoyable, but would fair well with a nice crust for consistency.\n\nDouble Chocolate Sundae ($6): Peanut Brittle, Hot Fudge, Cherry & Whipped Cream. Very CREAMY chocolate ice cream, as if it was not even frozen! The brittle baked thin, nutty...a very welcoming addition. Recommended!\n\nTo quench the thirst:\n\nChamomile Breeze ($10) & The Orchard ($10). The former delicate with a fair amount of citrus, the latter a bit sweet with cinnamon and apples, yet finishing with a nice bourbon undertone.\n\nOverall, an excellent choice on the Linq boulevard, more enjoyable than my last few stops in the area.  Would be a great place to catch the game, grab some good food, or a pit stop before/after the Wheel.  \n\n....Just make sure to ORDER THE SWEET CHILI PRAWNS!!", "review_id": "bqUhQ0FMFSqe-rSxk7LIHQ"}

{"text": "Great food, even better service. When I sat down at the bar I was immediately greeted by 'Joey' who asked my name. He was very friendly and accommodating. Other reviews I read before I came here mentioned the service and believe them all. The greeting wasn't all the discussion I had from the bar, which isn't normal for me as I'm not seeing that at bars as much anymore, nor do I invite it. These guys really put forth the effort to make conversation.\n\nI ordered the baked chicken wings (a few pics already so didn't add to the pile) they were amazing. 6 to an order for $9, they aren't spicy (recommend to the owner to make this an option) but they still taste great (I personally enjoy spicy food). I followed this up with a slice of cheesecake. Let me tell you as a cheesecake fanatic, this is good. \n\nCan't stress enough the service, everyone here makes a strong effort to engage in conversation with their customers. I see it with all the patrons currently sitting in the room. I had a nice discussion about my company and CES with Mario. Really nice and knew my company just by looking at my shirt. Not that I work for an obscure company, but he was or seemed genuinely interested in what I do.\n\nSo let's get down to it, why would I give 4 instead of 5 stars with all the nice things I have to say. Well one thing is I'm a stingy bastard when it comes to ratings, if everyone is 5 stars then everyone is the same again, so what's the point. The other is I do have a couple requests of the establishment to make it better for me. 1 the beer selection is lacking. I'm a dark beer drinker, they have one dark on the menu that's not my style, which is ok because if you don't drink beer or dark beer then who cares. The other goes back to the wings, taste great, but give me a spicy option or at least some hot sauce on the side.\n\nAgain, great food and better service, check this place out of you're in Vegas", "review_id": "bItU-5S-x6HwM7QitljG5g"}

ON 2 OCCASIONS IN A ROW they forgot to add the tomato and cheese. I had to bring it back to the counter and explain it to them. The SAME staff prepared it both times... so apparently they don't learn their lesson nor do they care.\n\n(2) Pricing and menu layout is inaccurate and incredibly confusing. They have a HUGE sign on the OUTSIDE window stating that the \"Big Chicken Deluxe\" is 2-for-$6 yet on the menu (at the top) inside the building, it says it's 2-for-$5 ... I pointed this out to the cashier and she did nothing to get this corrected. So, I ended up paying MORE than what the menu says.\n\n(3) For some strange reason, they make EVERYTHING available except napkins.

{"text": "Went for dinner with friends tonight. The place itself looks great, loved the lighting and projections on walls. That is the only thing that we found we liked. The music was a little loud and played during the commercials on TV, it was good club music though. When game came back on they switched on the audio for TVs. This was so loud that we could not talk across the table or even to the person next to us without raising our voices. This would not be a place to sit down for a relaxed meal and enjoy the company of the people you are with. Staff were friendly and for the most part attentive although apologized a lot for things they did not yet have. \n\nWe visited the website for the restaurant which is quite well done, the phone number listed though goes to a property management company that is not open on weekends. This number is on the website as well as on their facebook site. The menu on the website looked very good with a lot of options, once we got to the restaurant there was a limited menu. This was explained as they were trying some other options. The menu was so limiting as to have no appeal. Since they were trying out some options you would think they would come back and ask you what you that of them but this never occurred. There were salads but no appetizers. If you drink alcohol there were certainly options available. However, when ice tea was requested the response was the company they contract with had not delivered it so there was no ice tea yet. Certainly picking up a few bags of cold brew tea at a grocery store could solve this until vendor delivers. \n\nAs to the food itself, the short ribs had good flavor however they were cold inside. There was an Navajo fry bread option that had lamb on it. The flavor of the lamb, although a tad bit salty was overall very good. The \"fry bread\" itself was inedible. It was nearly impossible to bite through and the taste was unpleasant. Of the three slightly bigger than silver dollar sized fry breads less than one of the actual bread parts was eaten. The meatballs were underwhelming and another ravioli/noodle dish looked so unappetizing as to not want to eat it. The Caesar salad was unremarkable and nothing about it wowed us. Portion sizes were small when based on price. The dishes almost seemed like appetizers rather than entrees\n\nHope this is just the issue that happens with a new opening and that they have success. It is concerning though if they have been open for less than two weeks and are already trying new menu options. The online menu was certainly appealing, the menu in the restaurant, had it been on line we never would have gone. Based on quantity and quality after we got done eating there we left and went out to eat.

{"text": "So sllllloooowww. Ordered a fiesta plate,\nBeef kalaguen, and a spam musubi. Waited almost 50 minutes for it. So don't go when it's busy. Or order ahead.  \n\nSummary: long wait time. skip the grilled meats and get the other items. \n\nOnto the plate: Sub the salad if possible it's a throwaway and makes the fiesta plate feel like it's not worth the price. \n\nCan the red rice can be more red? If eaten with the meats it gets lost. And the meat just tastes like grilled meats. The beef and pork was tough. Chicken was the best. The chicken kelaguen was good reminded me of larb. But the best thing were the shrimp patties! Crispy outside and tender in the center. \n\nBeef kelaguen was nice (like beef ceviche) and one of the better things i had. Ordered it with yummy corn (+1$) titiya(tortilla) \n\nSpam musubi was good but again would be better if the red rice was more spiced or however they make it. Tasted like any other musubi.\n\nI'm no expert in Guam food but I didn't feel like I got a real taste of it from what I ordered.", "review_id": "afYObftEb-egKdDOXb8cDw"}
{"text": "Red Rice serves the best chicken kelaguen!  \n\nI am Chamoru and grew up eating Chamoru food and this place by far has the best chicken kelaguen I have ever had.  I ordered the Grand Opening Plate which had 2 scoops of red rice, 1 scoop of chicken kelaguen, 1 lumpia, 1 shrimp patty, house salad (it was a choice between potato salad, grilled eggplant with coconut milk, or cucumber salad), bbq chicken, 1 bbq pork rib, bbq beef and a side of dipping sauce for the meat. The red rice was as it should be, orange-reddish color and not dry or too wet with a subtle flavor of achote which definitely complimented the other items on the plate.  The bbq chicken was my favorite out of all the bbq.  Grilled eggplant with coconut milk was just like my mom used to make, creamy and somewhat smoky with a slight citrus twist.  \n\nI went to Red Rice for dinner during their grand opening and though there was a bit of a wait, it was understandable.  The service was great though.  They apologized for the wait and even gave me 10% off my next visit which is a plus because I will be back.

Tasted very authentic and now there's a place I can go to when I'm craving some red rice and kelaguen. The kimchee was also great! \n\nBut, I think that next time, I will just order for pick up. Maybe it was the fact that they just opened, but the room for sitting is very limited. There's about 8 booths that seats 4 and one table for 6. There was 7 of us and someone had to sit in the car to eat. Yeah.... That wasn't too pleasant. The wait for the food is about 15-20 minutes after ordering. But the up side to that is that they make everything fresh. \n\nAside from that, I really have no complaints when it came to the quality and taste of the food. My niece and sister loved the lumpia (egg rolls) and I also liked it and the shrimp patty is also an honorable mention. Perhaps they might expand, which I hope they do.

{"text": "My family and I decided to go here for our last dinner in Vegas and we were intrigued by buffet renovation. The new interior design is fresh, modern, and way more appealing than the old buffet. They even ditched the old \"Round Table Buffet\" name for \"The Buffet at Excalibur.\" The inside is pretty nice and the layout is basically just a straight line of stations where you can get food from standard buffet cuisines including the Asian, Italian, Latin, a carvery (has various cuts of meats), salads, seafood, and there is even a bar! The desserts station is located near the entrance so you can't miss it.\n\nThe food selection was decent, but I was able to see everything within 2 rounds of getting food. The seafood selection is nice since there are shrimps, crawfish, and crab legs. One thing to note is that the shrimp is not fully peeled for you unlike in some other buffets. The seafood paella is also hard to eat because the shrimp still has the shell and head! Their sushi selection consists of California rolls with or without masago, vegetable rolls, and I think there was spicy tuna. The sushi was above average compared to other buffets. \n\nHigh lights I found were the salmon, crab legs, and the made to order crepes from the dessert station. You can get nutella, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapples, and powdered sugar along with your crepe! The only downer is that the crepe is not as crispy as I would like it, but that's not a deal breaker for me. You can also get your crab legs steamed, but there is generally a line for that so just be warned. \n\nThere is a bar station located and you can get free champagne and mimosas along with your meal. All the other drinks will cost you additional money. \n\nOverall, I'd say you guys should give this place a try if you like going to buffets. It isn't the best, but it also isn't the worse. And believe me, it is much better than what it used to be.", "review_id": "eqhwSI7weVLsNvcRiVdIdA"}

{"text": "A very welcome addition to Central Scottsdale, Scottsdale Beer Company so far has proven to be awesome!\n\nI've been there twice since their soft opening on January 3, and I must say I am very impressed.\n\nTo put it this way, with independent restaurants that have no existing brand or footprint to have as support, it is up to the owner/developer to create something that works, and that won't fall victim to the statistic of the ever-so-prevalent failed restaurants/bars.  \n\nI think the owners/developers of Scottsdale Beer Company have it right, and I wish them much success.  \n\nWhen trying out new restaurants over the years, I can tell that sometimes it takes a good amount of time for many places to smooth out the wrinkles and overcome the glitches that can inevitably happen with a new operation.\n\nWell, after these two visits, my experience was absolutely stellar from start to finish.  I have no criticism whatsoever! \n\nOverall, I found Scottsdale Beer Company to...\n\n...have excellent, attentive service from every employee encountered.  And it wasn't just solid service - everyone went above and beyond to see that the food, drinks, and overall experience was top notch.  You could tell that not only did they hire the right people, that they must have been well-trained to really care about their customers.\n\n...have very tasty food!  The fish and chips were amazing, the blackened fish sandwich scrumptious, and the desserts very good.  My friends seemed to really enjoy their selections too.  Extra points for very nice presentation too, with nice dinnerware, etc.\n\n...good beer!  Granted, their brewery is not at full speed ahead yet, but their guest beers were really nice choices for all tastes.  In most bars around the area, it seems IPAs predominate the \"craft beer\" taps.  Nothing against IPAs, but they are not my personal favorites.  I tend to gravitate toward Belgian-style beers, porters, stouts, bocks, etc.  In their guest beer list (which changes daily), they had a really nice Belgian quad and Russian imperial porter, both of which were top notch.\n\n...a really nice atmosphere.  It is apparent from all the TVs throughout, that this would be a great place to watch a game.  Additionally, even if it were packed, there is enough spaced to where it wouldn't feel crowded.  The decor has clean lines and feels urban and industrial, which I like.  There was even an artist there chalking up nice designs on their really large chalkboards.  Nice music in the background, but just at the right volume to where everyone can still hear each other.  On nice 75 degree days like today, I would guess the \"garage door\" style windows they had lining one wall to the outdoor patio could really make the place have an amazing open, airy feel to take advantage of the great Scottsdale weather.\n\n...was impeccably clean.  Granted, it is brand new, but sometimes that doesn't mean anything to some restaurants.  The bathrooms were super clean, as well as everywhere else.\n\nBottom line, it is not only apparent that the owners here seem to really care about hopefully turning this place into a cash cow success, but they also really seem to care about delivering a fantastic experience to their patrons on all levels (which is the key to that cash cow success!).\n\nI hope that they can keep consistency, and that many subsequent reviews from other Yelpers can exclaim about a great time as well!

There are plenty of high and low tables and a nice outside patio.  With the doors rolled up you get a lot of fresh air when you're sitting inside and I love the big glass windows that look into the brewing area.\n\nI sat at the bar and didn't see a list of beers anywhere and a lot of the taps aren't marked even if you can see that far.  The waitress rattled off the beers but c'mon a real beer geek wants to see the details on the brewer, style, abv and ibu's.  It wasn't until later in the evening when they printed up a list that I could see everything they carried including a couple that the bartender didn't mention.\n\nI tried their pale ale and thought it was just Ok.  The flavors were a little muted and I'd love a little more citrus and pine flavor.  I ended up drinking an Avery Dugana and a Bell's Two-hearted which were great.\n\nFor happy hour my friend and I shared the hummus plate and a burger.  The white bean hummus was good but the flatbread was really tough to chew.  The burger was OK as was the mac and cheese side.  The mac and cheese would have been better if they added something like bread crumbs on top and then browned it to give it some crunch.\n\nI'll be interested to try some of their other beers.  Arizona Wilderness and Fate Brewing down the road are doing a great job with their own creations.

{"text": "If you are one of the multitude of 'Baby Boomers' that grew up with Slinkys, Silly Putty, \"The Cold War\", Jiffy Pop Popcorn, and you being your dad's t.v. remote, then the current production of \"I Love Lucy - Live\" will be right up your alley! Currently playing in the warm and inviting Capital Theater at Overture Center, this show is a wonderful diversion from the current cold temperatures outside. It will warm your heart and transport you back to a much simpler time and place.\n\nA representation of how television shows were filmed, yes.........filmed....in the 1950's and 60's, the production gives you a glimpse of how the 'I Love Lucy Show' was staged and the hi-jinx that occurred on stage. Between the period costumes, sets, music, and the entertaining commercials, you really feel like you've been transported back to 1952! I really felt like I should have had that Banquet T.V. dinner sitting right in front of me.\n\nLucy, portrayed expertly by Thea Brooks, gives us all the well-known mannerisms, lines, fake crying, and calls for \"Rickyyyyyyyy\", that we would fully expect. Euriamis Losada, who portrays Lucy's harried and lovable husband Ricky, belts out the show tunes that would make the original performer proud. Backed by a cast of seasoned singers/actors/dancers, this national touring company does a wonderful job of transporting you back to the glory days of Hollywood.\n\nAs many Lucy re-runs as I remember seeing as a kid, I don't remember the two episodes that are presented as being produced and filmed, if they were really produced. However, the Madison Avenue ad-men that created some of the corniest commercials ever (at least by today's standards), and which really were produced, would be totally pleased to hear how many of their singing commercials I, and others in the crowd, knew the words to. Hard to forget 'a little dab will do ya!\"\n\nSo whether you're a baby-boomer or a Gen-X'er, you've no doubt seen at least one I Love Lucy Show and seeing this production live, and in living color!, will probably be the best two hours you'll spend over the next week. Now let's get down there Baba-luuuuuuuu!", "review_id": "cXil6tQJpfECd2aXm0xKtQ"}
{"text": "What a fun time on a cold, cold night! I grew up watching I Love Lucy, so was excited to go and see this show. I was not disappointed. It was done as you were in the audience at a taping of two I Love Lucy shows, complete with commercials for Alka Seltzer, Halo Shampoo, Brylcream and Chevrolet. Costumes were spot on, including Lucy's navy blue polka dotted dress, of course. They worked in little \"tricks\" from back then of producing the show and the man that emcee'd was great.  The man that plays Ricky is just spot on with his accent and mannerisms! Lucy, Ethel and Fred all do a great job of making us believe we have been transported back in time. It was a totally enjoyable evening that made me laugh and remember back to the good old days. I miss those days of TV after seeing this production and may need an I Love Lucy marathon.\n\nThanks Corey for organizing and it was great to finally meet you in person!", "review_id": "MttZpCoNcseMzdZW8GUpcw"}
{"text": "When Corey sent the email about tickets being available for the show I jumped at the opportunity to score 2 free tickets. What a fun night! I honestly didn't watch a ton of I Love Lucy when I was little, but I knew enough about the show to know (kind of) what to expect. \n\nBut the show was so much better than I even expected. The cast were great, and Lucy and Ricky were perfect in their roles. I loved the combination of humor from the show, and humor from pulling an audience member on stage. My boyfriend and I were both entertained the entire time. \n\nThe Overture Center is beautiful, and our seats weren't half bad at all. Only complaint was that they are so close together. My boyfriend was pretty uncomfortable by the end of the show. He's pretty tall so he had to pretty much sit in a ball the whole time. But, I realize that's not always something that can be avoided!", "review_id": "8Fi-J5Ttq9o0t8MD1Mc9FA"}
{"text": "This show really captured the magic of I Love Lucy. The leads make you forget that it really isn't the stars of the show.  The additional touches sometimes outshined the actual show. The cute commercials that are reminiscent of the time added a special touch.\n\nThe cast is small but each cast member is so talented. They are highlighted in different skits and episodes. While there are two stars of the show, the supporting cast is phenomenal. \n\nThe Overture Hall was the perfect size for the show. I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who loved the show or is looking for a lighthearted night out.", "review_id": "-LIkro7FtdMxOg1P1MAPUw"}

Then, they were supposedly heating my order up with their toaster oven press and when I got to my room it was as if they had taken it out of the refrigerator.  Too bad I didn't notice it until I was already to my room.  Obviously they didn't have their little heater plugged in or something.  Plus, the woman at the counter who took my cash didn't even say thank you.  The other lady who thought she was heating up my order did say thank you to me.  That's the only reason they're getting two stars and not one.  You provide lousy service; you get one or two stars from me on Yelp.  Don't underestimate the power of reviews from real customers.

{"text": "I've actually been trying to come here since the last time I visited Las Vegas but it always seem to be closed when I tried to go. I FINALLY WENT! They had so many different pastries and baked goods to choose one. It took me a while to decide on the Better Nutter (reinvented nutter butter) and a tropezienne (not really sure if that's spelled correctly). My boyfriend got the strawberry croissant and the pain au chocolat.\n\n I really enjoyed the Better Nutter. It was very tasty, and brought back the memories of eating Nutter Butters but SOOOOO MUCH BETTER. I'd definitely come back for these =] highly recommended\n\nThe tropezienne is like a bready pastry with cream in the middle, there was also strawberry slices in it. It was good but if I could only choose one I'd go for the Better Nutter.\n\nI also tried the strawberry croissant, and that was very tasty also.\n\nOverall, I'll be coming back to Bouchon on my next visit to Las Vegas", "review_id": "OBCKARJaQLiRiZrrIpuN_g"}
{"text": "The bottom line: A breath of fresh air to find such good pastries in the middle of the LV strip no less. I took a star off for the horrible American style coffee. How can a place like this not have proper European coffee?!\n\nThe Pros: The pastries are very good and some are unique (i.e. I have not seen them elsewhere - such as the strawberry croissant). The service was nice every time we were there. I think that the prices are fair for the product.\n\nThe Cons: The coffee is not good at all.

Don't want to be repetitive to other reviews so I'm just going to list some drinks I always love to get.\n\nLocated at The Venetian Hotel on casino level, Bouchon Bakery is pretty hidden to first timers. DO NOT get this mistaken for Bouchon Restaurant, this is totally separate area. Bouchon Bakery is a small coffee/bakery stand tucked behind a set of escalators closest to parking garage down to casino level.\n\nI always get:\n-small hot caramel macchiato. \n-small hot hazelnut latte.\n\nPerfect amount of caffeine and flavoring. This place sure beats the heck outta that nasty Coffee Bean literally located just right on the second level.

{"text": "First: Please note that many people are reviewing the restaurant  NOT the bakery. \nMy review is for the bakery. I have been coming here for years, but I am extremely sad to report that my last two visits have revealed that they just don't care any more. \n\nThey seem content to just coast on their laurels selling this stuff to rubes and foreigners \n\nThe coffee is good, but the pastry is where they need to re-focus.  \n\nFirst, the biggest offender is their Macarons. They served us a nasty hateful hard lump of a cookie last week. This thing was seriously rock hard. They are supposed to be crispy with a slightly softer interior.  That is the WHOLE POINT of the cookie.  When we complained they said \"that is the way they are supposed to be, and the softer ones are old\" No, no, they are not. You overcooked the crap out of these which formed, essentially, a meringue. \n I have eaten Macrons across the world and made them myself. I was in Paris a few month ago and took down a half dozen of these from Laduree. I am pretty familiar with this stupid little cookie because my wife loves them. \n\nDo not insult me by telling me this hammer-substitute is in any way acceptable. They told us to take it up with the downstairs location if we did not like it and refused to refund or exchange the cookie.  Astounding. \n\nThe rest of the menu items have just gone downhill. Their croissants are all but indistinguishable from the stuff they sling at buffets.  The outside should be flakey and the inside tender. Not some glupey congealed mess. You know how I know its a terrible croissant? There was absolutely no flakes to clean up. \n\nI hope Dominique Ansel opens a location and shows you guys whats up.", "review_id": "XvfcIuf8nA-wW1U6eEZy8Q"}
{"text": "So this is *not* the restaurant.  This is the little stand at the bottom by the escalators @ the Venetian.  The Bouchon restaurant is at the 10th floor of the Venetian, which I was super confused with after reading these reviews initially. \n\nSo let's review the bakery first: \n\n1) BOUCHON BAKERY - (little stand)\nThis is a line-up grab & go service.  They serve a variety of delicious cookies, cupcakes, and pastries as well as coffees & other hot drinks.  The stuff they have is delicious.  Definitely try their almond croissant and their chocolate croissant.  Their chocolate croissant even beats Jean Phillipe (at the Bellagio).  If you've got an insane sweet tooth, then try the apple croissant.  I wouldn't suggest that one for breakfast though b/c it was way too sweet for my liking. \n\n2) BOUCHON RESTAURANT - 10th floor of the Venetian \nSo like everywhere in the Vegas hotels, you take a convoluted route before you can actually find your final destination because everything here is so big.  However, this restaurant was well worth the convoluted trip.  There is a huge variety of brunch options including quiches, pastries, eggs, etc.  I like that they can do your eggs *any* style and they mean it - including scrambled egg whites - my favourite.  I also ADORED their chocolate croissant - it was seriously delicious.  They have that downstairs at the bakery too.  \n\nSo overall, a great find and definitely worth going again!", "review_id": "MdFjcd5ECi_hAL9x3O2PxA"}
